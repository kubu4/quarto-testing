Used a subset (10 samples) from [the _Ostrea lurida_ gDNA isolated 20150916](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2015/2015-09-16-dna-isolation-olympia-oyster-whole-body.html) to prepare RAD libraries. This will be done to assess whether or not these samples, [which appear to be heavily degraded](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/09/17/agarose-gel-olympia-oyster-whole-body-gdna-integrity-check.html), are viable for RAD-seq./

Followed the [2bRAD protocol (PDF) developed by Eli Meyer's lab](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/External_Protocols/2bRAD_11Aug2015.pdf).

Prepared 1.2μg of each of the following samples in a volume of 10μL:

Prepared a 150μM working stock of the SAM buffer needed for the restriction digestion by diluting 30μL of the supplied stock (500μM) in 70μL NanoPure H2O (total volume = 100μL). This working stock was stored @ -20C in FTR 209 in the "RAD-seq Reagents" box.

Prepared master mix for restriction enzyme reaction:

Combined 4μL of the master mix with 8μL of each sample in 0.5mL snap cap tubes. Incubated @ 37C O/N in thermal cycler (no heated lid).

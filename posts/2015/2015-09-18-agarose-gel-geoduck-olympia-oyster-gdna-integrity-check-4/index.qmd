Ran a 0.8% agarose, 1x modified TAE gel (w/EtBr) with [geoduck and Olympia oyster gDNA that was precipitated earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2015/2015-09-17-ethanol-precipitation-geoduck-olympia-oyster-gdna.html). Used 5Î¼L of each sample (~500ng)./

Results:

Overall, the DNA still looks very good. Slight smearing (indicating slight degradation), but the high molecular weight band is very prominent. Will fill out the necessary BGI forms and ship samples out on Monday.

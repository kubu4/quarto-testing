In an attempt to figure out what's going on with the Illumina data we recently received for these samples, I BLASTed the 400ppm data set that had previously been _de-novo_ assembled by Steven: [EmmaBS400.fa](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/halfshell/EmmaBS400.fa).

I also created a nucleotide BLAST database (DB) from the [Crassostrea_gigas.GCA_000297895.1.24.fa](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/trilobite/Crassostrea_gigas_ensembl_tracks/Crassostrea_gigas.GCA_000297895.1.24.fa)

Results:

The results are not great.

All query contigs successfully BLAST to sequences in the _C.gigas_ Ensembl BLAST DB. However, only 33 of the sequences (out of ~37,000) have an e-value of 0.0. The next best e-value for any matches is 0.001. For the uninitiated, that value is not very good, especially when you're BLASTing against the same exact species DB.

Will BLASTn the _C.gigas_ contigs against the entire GenBank nt (all nucleotides) to see what the taxonomy breakdown looks like of these sequences.

Since many newer computers are coming _without_ optical disc drives (including my laptop, which I want to install this software on), I created an .iso disc image of the OpticonMonitor3 (BioRad) installation disc.

Using OS X Disk Utility:





  1. File > New Disk Image



  2. Dropdown > CD/DVD Master






This creates a Mac-specific .cdr image of the installation CD. Converted to a universal .iso disc image with the following command line:

`$hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o [filename].iso [filename].cdr`

Replaced `[filename]` with `OpticonMonitor3`.

Moved the newly created `OpticonMonitor3.iso` file to our server (Eagle/Backup/Software/Windows).

Now the .iso file should be able to be mounted and installed on any Windows computer without the need for a physical installation CD.

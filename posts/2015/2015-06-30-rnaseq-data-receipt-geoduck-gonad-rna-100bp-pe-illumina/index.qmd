Received notification that the [samples sent on 20150601 for RNAseq](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/06/01/sample-submission-geoduck-gonad-for-rna-seq.html) were completed.

Downloaded the following files from the GENEWIZ servers using FileZilla FTP and stored them on our server ([owl/web/nightingales/P_generosa](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_generosa/)):

Geo_Pool_F_GGCTAC_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz
Geo_Pool_F_GGCTAC_L006_R2_001.fastq.gz
Geo_Pool_M_CTTGTA_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz
Geo_Pool_M_CTTGTA_L006_R2_001.fastq.gz

Generated md5 checksums for each file:


    
    <code>$for i in *; do md5 $i >> checksums.md5; done</code>



Made a readme.md file for the directory.

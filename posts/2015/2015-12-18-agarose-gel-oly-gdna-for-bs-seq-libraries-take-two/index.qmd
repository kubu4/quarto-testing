[The gel I ran earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/12/17/agarose-gel-oly-gdna-for-bs-seq-libraries.html) looked real rough, due to the fact that I didn't bother to equalize loading quantities of samples (I just loaded 1Î¼L of all samples regardless of concentration). So, I'm repeating it using 100ng of DNA from all samples.

Additionally, this gel also [includes _C.gigas_ samples that Katie Lotterhos sent to us](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/12/10/samples-received-c-gigas-tissue-dna-from-katie-lotterhos.html) to see how they look.

Ran a 0.8% agarose, low-TAE gel, stained with ethidium bromide.

Results:

Look at that! The samples look MUCH nicer when they're not overloaded and uniformly loaded!

Most have a prominent high molecular weight band (the band that's closes to the top of the ladder, not the DNA visible in the wells). All exhibit smearing, but 2NF1 shows a weird accumulation of low molecular weight DNA.

Katie's _C.gigas_ samples (M1, M2, M3) look similar to the Olympia oyster gDNA, however her samples appear to have residual RNA in them (the fuzzy band ~500bp).

Will discuss with Steven which samples he wants to use for bisulfite treament and library construction.

The system was previously set to use Steven’s Comcast SMTP server. Sending a test email from Eagle failed, indicating authentication failure. I changed this to use the University of Washington’s email server for outgoing messages. Here’s how…

In the Synology Disk Station Manager (DSM):

Control Panel > Notifications




    
  * Service provider: Custom SMTP Server

    
  * SMTP server: smtp.washington.edu

    
  * SMTP port: 587

    
  * Username: myUWnetID@uw.edu

    
  * Password: myUWpassword

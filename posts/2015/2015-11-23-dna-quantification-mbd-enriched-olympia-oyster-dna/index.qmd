Quantified the MBD enriched samples prepped over the last two days: [MBD enrichment](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2015/2015-11-21-mbd-enrichment-sonicated-olympia-oyster-gdna.html), [EtOH precipiation](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/11/22/ethanol-precipitation-olympia-oyster-mbd.html)./

Samples were quantified using the QuantIT dsDNA BR Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Standards were run in triplicate, samples were run in duplicate.

96-well black (opaque) plate was used.

Fluorescence was measured on the Seeb Lab's Victor 1420 plate reader (Perkin Elmer).

Results:

Google Sheet: [20151123_MBD_libraries_quantification](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sGU8S_nGMEdRpB3nSye3lDyUUoZFmS2qHgeVSvqWS38/edit?usp=sharing)

Standard curve looked good - RÂ² = 0.999

MBD recovery ranged from ~250 - 600ng.

MBD percent recoveries ranged from ~2 - 20%. Input DNA quantities were taken from Katherine's numbers (Google Sheet): [Silliman-DNA-Samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1anTR7QLB1p_Oyh_hUIWKKHy21sSvVjwTZmdqqxwcpWM/edit?usp=sharing)

Will contact services about getting bisulfite Illumina sequencing performed.

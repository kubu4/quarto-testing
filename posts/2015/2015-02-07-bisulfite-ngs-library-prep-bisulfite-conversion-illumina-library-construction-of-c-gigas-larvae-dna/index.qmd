#### Bisulfite Conversion



The previous attempt at constructing a library for [the 1000ppm larvae samples failed](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2015/2015-01-28-bisuflite-ngs-library-prep-c-gigas-larvae-oa-bisulfite-library-quantification.html). I had previously [sheared, quantified](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/01/09/dna-isolation-c-gigas-larvae-from-2011-noaa-oa-experiment.html), and [concentrated](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/01/12/speedvac-c-gigas-larvae-oa-dna.html) the DNA from this sample. As I had done previously, I combined 50ng from each of the two 1000ppm samples for a total of 100ng, and brought the sample volume up to 24μL with NanoPure H2O./

Bisulfite conversion was performed with the Methylamp DNA Modification Kit (Epigentek) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Sample was eluted with 10μL of Buffer R6 for immediate use.





#### Library Prep



Bisulfite Illumina library was made with [EpiNext Post-Bisulfite DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) (Epigentek)(https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Epigentek_PostBisulfiteIlluminaLibraryPrep_P-1055.pdf).  Changes to the manufacturer's protocol:




    
  * Samples were transferred to 1.5mL snap cap tubes for all magnetic bead steps in order to fit in our tube magnets.

    
  * Skipped Step 7.1 (per manufacturer's recommendation for samples starting with <200ng)

    
  * Ran 13 cycles during the library amplification step (per manufacturer's recommendation for samples starting with 100ng)



Sample was transferred to 1.5mL snap cap tube and stored @ -20C.  Will quantify library on Monday when Jake is also finished with his 12 libraries.

The following DNased RNA samples [showed inconsistencies between qPCR reps (one rep showed amplification, the other rep did not) on 20150514](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/05/14/qpcr-jakes-o-lurida-ctenidia-dnased-rna-control-samples.html):




    
  * NC1

    
  * SC1

    
  * SC2

    
  * SC4



Reran these four samples to obtain a definitive answer as to whether or not they have residual gDNA in them prior to using them to make cDNA.

Used Oly_Actin primers (SR IDs: 1504, 1505)

Used 1μL from all templates.

All samples were run in duplicate.

Positive control was [HL1 _O.lurida_ DNA isolated by Jake on 20150323](https://heareresearch.blogspot.com/2015/03/3-23-2015-ezna-dna-isolation-with-seed.html).

Cycling params:




    
  * 95C – 2.5mins

    
  * 40 cycles of:

    
    * 95C – 10s

    
    * 60C – 20s




    
  * Melt curve

No amplification in any of the RNA samples, nor the NTCs. Will make cDNA.

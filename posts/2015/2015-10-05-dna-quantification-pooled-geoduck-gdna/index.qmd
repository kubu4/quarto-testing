Pooled the gDNA samples [from earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/10/05/gdna-isolation-geoduck-adductor-muscle.html) & [from 20151002](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/10/02/dna-isolation-geoduck-olympia-oyster.html).

The pooled volume = 260μL

Quantified on the Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000.

Results:

Besides the weird peak at 240nm, everything looks great - perfect 260/280 & 260/230 ratios.

Yield = 75.92μg

This gDNA has been RNase treated, so the concentration should be semi-accurate. Regardless, even if there's a discrepancy of 50%, this should provide enough additional DNA for BGI to work with.

Will run on gel to evaluate integrity and then send to BGI.

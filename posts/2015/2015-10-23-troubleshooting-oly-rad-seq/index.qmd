Oddly, it turns out that Katherine's version of the Meyer Lab 2bRAD protocol differed from what I had download. To add to the confusion, both protocols have the same file name. Here's what I'm talking about:

The file on the left is the one I was using and the one on the right is the file Katherine is using (NOTE: The file name's aren't exact because they were saved to the same directory and the numbers in the parentheses were appended to the file name automatically)

I've updated [our copy of the protocol in our GitHub account](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/External_Protocols/2bRAD_11Aug2015.pdf). However, Katherine informed me that she's just been pulling up the Meyer Lab page to reference the protocol. So, it's possible they made a change to the file after I initially downloaded it, but the change wasn't indicated in the file name.

However, when discussing with Katherine, she made a good point and said she just scaled up the test-scale PCR. Since the test-scale PCR was successful, she didn't see a need to make any changes.

Will try this procedure again with the correct protocol; probably by scaling up the test-scale PCR.

Quantified the RNA I isolated from Jake's samples on [20150715](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/07/15/rna-isolation-o-lurida-ctenidia-1hr-post-mechanical-stress-2.html) and [20150710](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/07/10/rna-isolation-o-lurida-ctenidia-1hr-post-mechanical-stress.html) using the Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000 (ThermoFisher).

Overall, the yields are good. The 260/280 ratios are mediocre. Will proceed with DNase treatment.

DNased 1.5ug of RNA from each sample using the Turbo DNA-free Kit (Ambion/Life Technologies), following the “rigorous” protocol.

Briefly:




    
  * 50μL reactions were carried out in 0.5mL tubes

    
  * added 1μL of DNase to each tube

    
  * incubated 30mins @ 37C

    
  * added additional 1μL of DNased

    
  * incubated 30mins @ 37C

    
  * added 0.2 vols (10.2μL) of DNase Inactivation Reagent

    
  * incubated and mixed for 2mins @ RT

    
  * spun 1.5mins, 10,000g @ RT

    
  * transferred 50μL of supe to sterile 1.5mL snap cap tubes

    
  * spec’d on Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000



Samples were stored @ -80C in [Shellfish RNA Box #6](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ax6C-muxUTXxFEtfWdswBvueLhmxZzmwZcO2ur-0q-Q/edit?usp=sharing). Will quantify at a later date.

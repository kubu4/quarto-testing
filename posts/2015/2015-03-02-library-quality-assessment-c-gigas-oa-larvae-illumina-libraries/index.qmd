Ran the [400ppm library](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/01/28/bisuflite-ngs-library-prep-c-gigas-larvae-oa-bisulfite-library-quantification.html) and the [1000ppm library](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/02/27/bs-seq-library-prep-c-gigas-larvae-oa-1000ppm.html) preps on a DNA1000 Assay Chip (Agilent) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

Data File (XAD): [2100_expert_DNA_1000_DE72902486_2015-03-02_09-18-02.xad](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Bioanalyzer%20Data/2100%20expert_DNA%201000_DE72902486_2015-03-02_09-18-02.xad)

Electropherogram overlay of both samples:

Red = 400ppm

Blue = 1000ppm

Measurement data and parameters are here: [20150302_Bioanalyzer_Cgigas_400_1000ppm_BS-Seq](20150302_Bioanalyzer_Cgigas_400_1000ppm_BS-Seq)





Both libraries look good; no adaptor contamination (peak would be present at ~125bp), good library sizes.

Pooled equal quantities of each library, based off the concentration values above, to prepare the sample for sequencing.

The pooled libraries will be submitted tomorrow to the [Genomics Core Facility at the Univ. of Oregon](https://gcf.uoregon.edu/) for high-throughput sequencing (100bp, SE) on the HiSeq2500 (Illumina). Sample order #2212.

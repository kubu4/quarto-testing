Since the [_O.lurida_ RNA I isolated on 20150506](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/05/06/rna-isolation-jakes-o-lurida-ctenidia-1hr-heat-stress-from-20150422.html) showed [residual gDNA via qPCR](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/05/12/qpcr-jake-o-lurida-ctenidia-rna-heat-shock-samples-from-20150506.html), I treated 1.5μg of RNA from each sample using the Turbo DNA-free Kit (Ambion/Life Technologies), following the "rigorous" protocol.

Briefly:




    
  * 50μL reactions were carried out in 0.5mL tubes

    
  * added 1μL of DNase to each tube

    
  * incubated 30mins @ 37C

    
  * added additional 1μL of DNased

    
  * incubated 30mins @ 37C

    
  * added 0.2 vols (10.2μL) of DNase Inactivation Reagent

    
  * incubated and mixed for 2mins @ RT

    
  * transferred 50μL of supe to sterile 1.5mL snap cap tubes

    
  * spec'd on Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000



Samples were stored @ -80C in [Shellfish RNA Box #5 and Box #6](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzcHdyU1d0MDVMLWpaTWdadnJSd0M4UUE&usp=sharing).

All samples look pretty good except for HT1 8 (RNA concentration is ridiculously high!) and NT1 8 (RNA concentration is way below expected). Will check for residual gDNA via qPCR.

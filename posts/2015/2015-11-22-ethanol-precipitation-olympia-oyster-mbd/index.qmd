Precipitated [the MBD enriched DNA from yesterday](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/11/21/mbd-enrichment-sonicated-olympia-oyster-gdna.html) according to the MethylMiner Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit (Invitrogen) protocol.

However, since the protocol has two elution steps that are each saved separately from each other for each sample, I did the following to combine the two elution fractions into a single sample:




    
  * Pelleted one elution fraction from each sample

    
  * Discarded supernatant from pelleted sample

    
  * Transferred second elution fraction to the pellet from the first elution fraction

    
  * Pelleted second elution fraction



The rest of the ethanol precipitation procedure was followed per the manufacturer's protocol.

Final pellets were resuspended in 25Î¼L of Buffer EB (Qiagen) and stored @ 4C.

MBD enriched DNA will be quantified tomorrow.

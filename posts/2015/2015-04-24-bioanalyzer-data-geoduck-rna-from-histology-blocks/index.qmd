I received the Bioanalyzer data back for the [geoduck foot RNA samples I submitted 20150422](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/04/22/bioanalyzer-submission-geoduck-rna-from-histology-blocks.html). The two samples were run on the RNA Pico chip assay.



Results:

Bioanalzyer 2100 Data File (XAD): [SamWhite_Eukaryote Total RNA Pico_2015-04-23_13-04-16.xad](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Bioanalyzer%20Data/SamWhite_Eukaryote%20Total%20RNA%20Pico_2015-04-23_13-04-16.xad)

Data file requires 2100_Expert_B0208_SI648_SR2 version of the software (Windows).

The samples look really good! As we've seen previously in shellfish RNA, there is a single, prominent rRNA band/peak with very little degradation (smearing and/or no prominent peak/band).

Will proceed with RNA isolation from the remaining histology blocks.

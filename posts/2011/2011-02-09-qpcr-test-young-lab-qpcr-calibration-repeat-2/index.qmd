This was repeated from earlier today due to the failure of the previous run, but had to use new gDNA since I ran out of the stock I had previously used. M[aster mix calcs and cycling params are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110208-01.jpg).

Results:

Amplification in all wells, however well E4 appears to have had some evaporation (and the effects can clearly be seen in the amplification plot below). Still getting ~3 cycle spread across the entire plate, which is disconcerting. Oddly, this is the second day where the 1st run completely failed, but the 2nd run was successful...

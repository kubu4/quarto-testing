RNA was isolated in 1mL TriReagent, according to protocol. Samples were resuspended in 50uL 0.1% DEPC-H2O and spec'd. RNA was stored @ -80C in "[Shellfish RNA Box #4](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?hl=en&key=pwrSWt05L-jZMgZvrRwC8QA&hl=en#gid=3)

RNA looks OK. Not surprising, but mantle and Dg/Gonad tissues ended up with poor OD260/230 ratios. This has been observed in the past with these tissue types.

Ran a qPCR on all cDNA samples from the V.vulnificus exposure experiment from [20110111](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan+2011+-+March+2011#sjw20110111). Primers used were Cg_COX1/2_qPCR_F (SR ID: 1192) & Cg_COX1_qPCR_R (SR ID: 1191). Samples were run in duplicate. [Master mix calcs are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110601-01.jpg). Plate layout, cycling params, etc., can be seen in the qPCR Report (see Results).

Data looks good (e.g. the replicates are all very close, with the largest Cq Std. Deviation = 0.534), nothing in the NTCs, & the melt curves look good. Will eventually normalize the data and then perform a complete analysis.

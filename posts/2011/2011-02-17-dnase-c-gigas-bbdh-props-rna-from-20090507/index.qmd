Need more DNased RNA to finish repeating of PROPS. Some samples had insufficient quantities of DNased RNA remaining in BB01 and BB09. Used 10ug of each RNA and followed Ambion's "rigorous" protocol, utilizing a total of 2uL of DNAse for each sample. Briefly, samples were incubated @ 37C for 30mins, an additional 1uL of DNase was added to each sample, mixed and incubated for an additional 30mins @ 37C. After finishing protocol, samples were spec'd.

DNase Rxn Calcs:

BB01 (1.824ug/uL): 10ug/1.824ug/uL = 5.48uL RNA + 39.52uL H2O (to 45uL) + 5uL 10X DNase Buffer = 50uL

BB09 (0.506ug/uL): 10ug/0.506ug/uL = 19.77uL RNA + 25.23uL H2O (to 45uL) + 5uL 10X DNase Buffer = 50uL

Results:

260/280 values look great. 260/230 values look bad, but this is not unusual for samples post-DNase treatment.

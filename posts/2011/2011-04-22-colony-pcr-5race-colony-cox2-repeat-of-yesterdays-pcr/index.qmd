Repeated yesterday's PCR on the re-streaked colony in order to run the product on a gel with a more appropriate ladder. See yesterday's entry for all PCR info.

Results:

Lane 1: Hyperladder I

Lane 2: colony PCR

Lane 3: NTC

A band of nearly ~950bp is seen in the colony PCR, suggesting that the cloning reaction was successful. However, this does not match up with the expected size of ~1500bp seen on 20110407. Will sequence this regardless. Also, the gel on 20110407 may not have run properly (see image from that dat), which could possibly explain why we don't see the "expected" size band of ~1500bp? Will inoculate a liquid culture for mini prep for eventual sequencing.

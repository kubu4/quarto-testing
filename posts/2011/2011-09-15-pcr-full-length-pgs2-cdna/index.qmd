Repeated PCR from 20110825 to attempt to amplify the full-length cDNA for PGS2 (COX2), however this time using a more robust polymerase (Amplitaq Gold) in hopes of getting results. Additionally, tried 3 different Mg2+ concentrations (1.5mM, 2.0mM, and 3.0mM). [Master mix calcs and cycling params are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110914-01.jpg). cDNA was pooled cDNA made [20110311](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan+2011+-+March+2011#sjw20110311) from various tissues. PGS2 primers = 1376, 1375.

PGS2 expected size = ~2500bp

Loading order doesn't matter, as there are no bands. Ladder is Hyperladder I (Bioline). Will continue current sequence analysis and potentially design a new set of primers...

5ug of RNA was DNased using Ambion's Turbo DNA-free kit, following the rigorous protocol (0.5uL of DNase for 30 mins then additional 0.5uL of DNase for 30mins). [Calcs for DNase reactions are here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzdEYzZEFjSXlGRUgzVUZBekpzZTMybmc&hl=en&authkey=CJ6rp5cM). RNA was stored @ -80C in Shellfish RNA Boxes [4](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzcHdyU1d0MDVMLWpaTWdadnJSd0M4UUE&hl=en#gid=3) and [5](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzcHdyU1d0MDVMLWpaTWdadnJSd0M4UUE&hl=en#gid=4). Samples will be spec'd on Monday.

Overall, the RNA looks really good (based on OD 260/280 numbers). Not surprisingly, the OD 260/230 values for all samples dropped, likely due to the addition of the buffer (salts) used in the DNase reaction. Emma says she will check these samples for residual DNA.

--UPDATE (20110131)-- Emma checked all DNased RNA samples on 20110131 using C.gigas 18s primers (SR ID: ?). She has not listed the results of the whether or not all samples are clean or if some still have residual gDNA carryover.

--UDPATE (20110201-- Samples that appear to have residual gDNA carryover based on Emma's qPCR on 20110131: Muscle C6, Gill 1hr C2 & E2.

Added 0.1 vols of 3M sodium acetate (pH = 5.2; 38uL) and 2 vols of 100% EtOH (836uL). Incubated 30mins @ -20C. Pelleted DNA 16,000g, 15mins, 4C. Removed supe. Washed pellet w/1mL 70% EtOH. Pelleted DNA 16,000g, 15mins, 4C. Removed supe. Air-dried pellet. Resuspended in 50uL of Qiagen EB Buffer and spec'd.

Results:

Insufficient quantity of DNA for sequencing. Will re-run PCR, but will use some of this purified DNA as template to see if that helps increase yields.

Ran PCR using primers Cg_COX_982_F and Cg_COX_2138_R (SR IDs: 1149 & 1151, respectively). Template was pooled cDNA from 20110311 of various C.gigas tissues. These primers anneal 5' and 3' of where the qPCR primers for both COX1/PGS1 and COX2/PGS2 anneal. [Master mix calcs and cycling params are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20111006-02.jpg). Ran multiples of the same reaction to ensure sufficient product for use in cloning/PCR.

Gel is loaded with Hyperladder I (Bioline) and 7 samples (no NTC; don't ask). Band in each lane is of the expected size (~1200bp). Each band was excised and purified using Ultra-free DA columns (Millipore), according to protocol. Purified DNA will be used in a subsequent PCR using the qPCR primers for COX/PGS 1&2 BEFORE cloning this product for sequencing.

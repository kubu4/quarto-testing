The bands that were excised and purified earlier today were cloned in to pCR2.1 using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following changes: used 4uL of all PCR products, incubated ligation reactions for 15mins @ RT, incubated competent cells with ligation reactions for 15mins on ice.

Two volumes of each reaction were plated (50uL and 100uL) on Kan50 plates with X-gal (made 20010412 by SJW) and incubated @ 37C O/N.

Results:

Ample number of white colonies for all 4 sets of cloning reactions.

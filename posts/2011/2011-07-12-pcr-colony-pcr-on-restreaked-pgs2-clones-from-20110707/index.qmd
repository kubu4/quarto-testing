Ran a colony PCR at the same time that I inoculated liquid cultures, using M13 primers.

Cycling params:




    
  * 94C - 10m



40 cycles of:


    
  * 94C - 1m

    
  * 50C - 1m

    
  * 72C - 2m



Results:

Lane 1: Hyperladder I

Lane 2: PGS Lo 1

Lane 3: PGS Hi 3

Lane 4: PGS Hi 4

Lane 5: Neg. Control

The only colony with an insert is PGS Hi 4. Will run a plasmid prep. However, this is the same sample that was sent for sequencing that produced nothing but vector sequence...

Used EtOH precipitated BB01 RNA from [20110225](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan+2011+-+March+2011#sjw20110225) and followed Ambion's "rigorous" protocol, utilizing a total of 2uL of DNAse. Briefly, samples were incubated @ 37C for 30mins, an additional 1uL of DNase was added to each sample, mixed and incubated for an additional 30mins @ 37C. After finishing protocol, samples were spec'd.

Results:

RNA looks good, based on the OD260/280. As usual after DNasing, the OD260/230 is on the low side. Will check for residual gDNA via qPCR.

Ran PCRs on both the 5' & 3' RACE libraries created 20080619 with a new COX2 gene-specifc (GSP) primer designed by Steven (CgPGSRACEsrGSP1; SR ID: 1208). Although this primer was designed to obtain additional 5' sequence, it was used with both 5' and 3' libraries as a precaution in case it accidentally designed on the wrong strand. PCR rxn was set up according to the Clontech SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit. [Master mix calcs are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110406-01.jpg). PCR cycling followed "Program 1" from the Clontech manual for 25 cycles.

After PCR completion, 5uL were transferred to a clean tube and saved, in case this PCR didn't work and a nested PCR would need to be performed. This is according to the Clontech protocol. Samples were run on a 1.2% agarose gel, as instructed in the Clontech manual.

Results:

No bands of any kind in any sample, including the negative controls (gel not shown). Will perform nested PCR on both libraries in hopes of getting bands.

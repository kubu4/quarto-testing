Ran colony PCR on various colonies produced from cloning on 20110411. All colonies were picked, re-streaked on Kan50 plate(s) and PCR'd. [Master mix calcs are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20110425-01.jpg). Cycling params:




    
  * 95C - 10mins



40cycles of:


    
  * 95C - 30s

    
  * 55C - 30s

    
  * 72C - 3mins

    
  * 72C - 10mins

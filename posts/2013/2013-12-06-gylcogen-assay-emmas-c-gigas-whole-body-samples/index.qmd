Finally located the remaining half of Emma's samples. These had already been freeze dried AND pulverized! So, I just had to weigh out ~half of each sample for the glycogen assay.

Glycogen Assay:

Samples were placed in 3mL of 15% trichloracetic acid (TCA), vortexed and incubated for 1hr @ 4C.

Samples were spun 10mins, 3,000g, at 4C (in bucket rotor).

500uL of supernatant was transferred to 4mL of 100% EtOH, vortexed and incubated O/N @ 4C.

Will continue processing tomorrow.

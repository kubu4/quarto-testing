Performed an RT reaction on pooled herring gonad and liver mRNA from [20091026](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Sept-Oct+2009#sjw20091026) for James Raymond at the UNLV. A single RT reaction was performed using 12.75uL (208ng) of the pooled gonad mRNA and 5uL (132.5ng) of the pooled liver RNA, according to our default MMLV (Promega) protocol. After reaction was completed, sample was stored @ -20C and then shipped to James Raymond on 20130214.

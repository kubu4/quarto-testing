Performed a repeat of the failed PCR from 20130227, but used a pool of cDNA (made from 20110311 C.gigas cDNA) instead of a single sample and changed the annealing temp to 50C.

Results:

Same exact results as 20130227; nothing. As such, didn't take gel image. Will retry one more time using a long-distance polymerase, along with varying [MgCl2].

UPDATE 20130318: Doh! When talking about this at lab meeting today, I realized I'm trying to amplify the promoter (a genomic sequence) using cDNA! Will re-design primers and develop new cloning strategy for this!

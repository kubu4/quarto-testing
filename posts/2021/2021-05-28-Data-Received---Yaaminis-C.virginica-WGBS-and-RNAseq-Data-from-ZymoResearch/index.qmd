Yaamini received her sequencing data from ZymoResearch; both whole genome bisfulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNAseq. [I was tasked with downloading the data and running QC](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1209).

FastQ files were downloaded to Owl ([https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/C_virginica/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/C_virginica/)) and MD5 checksums were verified (not shown).

[See this GitHub repo for full set of metadata associated with these files](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-comparative-omics/tree/master/metadata).

Next up, I'll run [`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), as well as get our [nightingales spreadsheet](https://b.link/nightingales) updated.

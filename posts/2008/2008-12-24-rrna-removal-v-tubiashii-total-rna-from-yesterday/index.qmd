rRNA removal was continued from O/N precipitation. Processed the samples according to the [Ambion MICROBExpress Kit protocol](https://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Commercial%20Protocols:Manuals/Ambion%20-%20MICROBexpress%20bacterial%20mRNA%20kit.pdf) and resuspended final pellets in 25uL of The RNA Storage Solution. Samples were spec'd on the NanoDrop.

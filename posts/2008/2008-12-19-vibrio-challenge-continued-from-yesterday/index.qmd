Significantly more bacteria in the container containing autoclaved oysters. Collected 2 x 50mL from each treatment. Collected ~750mL from each treatment. Cells were pelleted 4000RPM, 15mins, 4C. Supe was removed and pellets frozen @ -80C.

100uL of a 1:1,000,000 dilution of the control bacteria were plated on 1x LB + 1% NaCl plates and incubated O/N @ RT. 100uL of a 1:10,000,000 dilution of the exposed bacteria were plated on 1x LB + 1% NaCl plates and incubated O/N @ RT. Control colony count the next day = 563 colony forming units (CFU). Exposed colony count the next day = 367 CFU.

**Control Calculations**
563 CFU/100uL = 5.63 CFU/uL
5.63 CFU/uL x 1:1,000,000 dilution = 5.63 x 10^6 CFU/uL
5.63 x 10^6 CFU/uL x 1000uL/mL = **5.63 x 10^9 CFU/mL**

**Exposed Calculations**
367 CFU/100uL = 3.67 CFU/uL
3.67 CFU/uL x 1:10,000,000 dilution = 3.67 x 10^7 CFU/uL
3.67 x 10^7 CFU/uL x 1000uL/mL = **3.67 x 10^10 CFU/mL**

Ran qPCR on the Taylor water filter DNA extracts from yesterday using V.tubiashii 16s primers (SR IDs: 455, 456). Used RE22 DNA as a positive control, provided by Elene. [Master mix calcs are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis//Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20120323-01.jpg). All samples were run in duplicate. Plate layout, cycling params, etc can be found in the qPCR Report (see Results).

All samples amplified, including the negative controls. Negative controls exhibited very weak, late amplification. Additionally, many of the samples have a "shoulder" or apparent double-peak present in the melt curves. Will repeat to see if I can eliminate amplification in negative control samples.

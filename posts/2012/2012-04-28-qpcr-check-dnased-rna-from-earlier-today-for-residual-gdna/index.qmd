Ran qPCR using V.tubiashii VtpA primers (from Elene; no SR ID). Used 0.5uL of each DNased RNA sample, which equals ~40ng of RNA, which would be the equivalent amount of RNA that would end up in a qPCR rxn after cDNA has been made (using 1uL of cDNA). Used the filter DNA extraction from samples #279 from DATE as a positive control. Master mix calcs are here. Plate layout, cycling params, etc. can be found in the qPCR Report (see Results).

All samples showed up negative, except for the positive control. Will proceed with making cDNA on Monday.

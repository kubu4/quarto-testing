Reconstituted all of the oligos and barcodes for library construction in TE (pH = 8.0) to a final concentration of 100uM. Created 10uM working stocks of all oligos and barcodes. All samples (stocks and working stocks) are stored @ -80C in their own box (Illumina Library Oligos & Barcodes) due to the fact that one of the oligos is an RNA oligo and requires storage at -80C.

Took heat-fragmented RNA provided by Emma (see Emma's Notebook, 7/3/2011) and proceeded to make first strand cDNA, as described in the [Eli Meyer protocol for Illumina HiSeq](https://genefish.fish.washington.edu/~srlab/Steven/Lab%20Protocols/RNASeq%20sample%20prep%20-%20HiSeq%20-%2004%20Apr%202012.pdf). [Master mix calcs are here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis//Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20120711-01.jpg). Samples were stored @ -20C after the reverse transcription and library construction will be continued tomorrow.

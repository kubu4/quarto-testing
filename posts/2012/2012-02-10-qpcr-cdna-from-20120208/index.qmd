Performed qPCR on all 12 samples. Used the following primers, provided by Elene, to detect V.tubiashii expression:




    
  * rseA_F/R

    
  * VtpA_F/R

    
  * VtpR_F/R



Used RE22 DNA (provided by Elene) as a positive control. Master mix calcs are the same as yesterday's qPCR, but using the primers mentioned above. Plate layout, cycling params, etc. can be found in the qPCR Report (see Results). All samples were run in duplicate.

Positive control worked in all primer sets. All no template controls were clean for all primer sets.

Only one sample (#411) produced any amplification. Amplification was detected in the vtpA primer set (mean Cq = 38.06). However, there was also amplification detected in one of the two replicates for sample #411 in the rseA primer set (Cq = 39.09).

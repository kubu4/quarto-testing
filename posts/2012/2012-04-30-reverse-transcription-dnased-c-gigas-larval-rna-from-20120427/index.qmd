Performed reverse transcription using random primers (Promega) diluted 1:100 (5ng/uL) with 175ng of DNased total RNA. Random primers were used because we will be targeting V.tubiashii RNA instead of eukaryotic RNA. Reverse transcription was performed with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. [Calcs are here](https://Calcs%20are%20here.%20%20).



Created dilutions of all samples to 100ng/uL in a volume of 50uL in preparation for qPCR analysis. [Calcs are here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzdElfN0xId2dZWTNkVmk5Ql9ZVW4tcWc#gid=0).

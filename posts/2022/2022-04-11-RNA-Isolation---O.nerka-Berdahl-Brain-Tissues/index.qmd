[Steven asked that I isolate RNA from the remainder of the Berdahl brain tissue samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1410) (GitHub issue).

For reference, [here's the original info provided regarding these samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1307) (GitHub issue).

Sample labelling was as follows:

Numbers refer to individuals:

1-15 are territorial individuals

16-30 are social individuals

Letters refer to tissues:

(A) brain
(B) liver
(C) gonads

The following brain samples were selected for RNA isolation:

- 6A
- 7A
- 8A
- 9A
- 10A
- 11A
- 12A
- 13A
- 14A
- 15A
- 17A
- 18A
- 19A
- 21A
- 22A
- 24A
- 26A
- 27A
- 28A
- 29A
- 30A


RNA was isolated using RNAzol RT (Molecular Research Center) and the Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (ZymoResearch), with the DNase I on-column treatment step. The brain tissues were split into 4 equal size portions. Each portion was homogenized individually. Forceps were rinsed in distilled H2O, soaked in 10% bleach solution for 10mins, and then rinsed in distilled H2O before re-use. All centrifugation steps were performed at 16,000g for 1 min. Here’s a brief overview of the process.

Tubes containing tissues were allowed to thaw completely at room temperature (RT). Tissues were homogenized in 500uL of TriReagent with “disposable” platic mortar/pestle tubes (1.5mL). After homogenization, an additional 500uL of TriReagent was added to the tube, vortexed and incubated at RT for 15mins. Homogenized samples were stored over night at -20<sup>o</sup>. 

The four tubes from each sample was pelleted and supernatant was transferred to a 15.0mL tube. An equal volume (4mL) of 100% ethanol was added to this supernatant and mixed thoroughly by vortexing. Direct-zol Microprep Kit protocol was followed from here on, including on-column DNase I treatment. Samples were eluted with 15uL of H2O.

RNA was quantified using the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity assay.

All RNA was stored @ -80<sup>o</sup>C in [Sam’s RNA Box #3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j9jm3b91IkVfG0EsSjQpR--t2R97YXEQPaOFqsOqjhc/edit?usp=sharing).

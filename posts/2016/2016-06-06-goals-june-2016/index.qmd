Current goals are as follows:





  * Complete Oly GBS data analysis. This is getting closer to actually being done. Had some issues with an external hard drive crashing. I've since replaced that and the analysis is running (it takes multiple days per stage of the analysis on Hummingbird).



  * Configure computing instances on Amazon AWS to improve our ability to handle these large data sets in a more timely fashion.



  * Begin using the UW's Hyak computing cluster to improve our ability to handles these large data sets in a more timely fashion.

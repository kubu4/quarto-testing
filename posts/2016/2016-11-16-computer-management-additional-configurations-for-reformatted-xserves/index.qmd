Sean got the remaining Xserves configured to run independently from the master node of the cluster they belonged to and installed OS X 10.11 (El Capitan).

The new computer names are Ostrich (formerly node004) and Emu (formerly node002).



He enabled remote screen sharing and remote access for them.

Sean also installed a working hard drive on Roadrunner and got that back up and running.

I went through this morning and configured the computers with some other changes (some for my user account, others for the entire computer):





  * Renamed computers to reflect just the corresponding bird name (hostnames had been labeled as "bird name's Xserve")



  * Created srlab user accounts



  * Changed srlab user accounts to Standard instead of Administrative



  * Created steven user account



  * Turned on Firewalls



  * Granted remote login access to all users (instead of just Administrators)



  * Installed Docker Toolbox



  * Changed power settings to start automatically after power failure



  * Added computer name to login screen via Terminal:





    
    <code>sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.ap\ple.loginwindow LoginwindowText "TEXT GOES HERE"</code>







  * Changed computer HostName via Terminal so that Terminal displays computer name:




    
    <code>sudo scutil --set HostName "TEXT GOES HERE"</code>







  * Installed Mac Homebrew (I don't know if installation of Homebrew is "global" - i.e. installs for all users)



  * Used Mac Homebrew to install `wget`



  * Used Mac Homebrew to install `tmux`

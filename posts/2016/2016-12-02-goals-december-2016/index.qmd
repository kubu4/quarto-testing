Well, I've finally progressed with the Olly GBS analysis!

I'm nearly finished with the analysis of the _de novo_ PyRad data. Next, I'll run PyRad using our Oly partial genome that we have from BGI. This will allow a more descriptive evaluation of SNP loci, since we'll actually be able to associate the SNPs with various gene annotations, thus providing more meaningful insight.

On the Oly genome front, I also need to submit samples for PacBio sequencing. This will be an attempt to fill in the gaps of the Oly genome scaffold we currently have.

Finally, if all goes well, I'll get something written up and submitted to Scientific Data.

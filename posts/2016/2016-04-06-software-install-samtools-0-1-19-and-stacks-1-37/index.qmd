Getting ready to analyze our _Ostrea lurida_ genotype-by-sequencing data and wanted to use the Stacks software.

We have an existing version of Stacks on Hummingbird (the Apple server blade I will be running this analysis on), but I figured I might as well install the latest version (stacks-1.37).

Additionally, Stacks requires samtools-0.1.19 to run, which we did NOT have installed.

I tracked all of this in the Jupyter (iPython) notebook below.

Due to permissions issues during installation, I frequently had to leave the Jupyter notebook to run "sudo" in bash. As such, the notebook is messy, but does outline the necessary steps to get these two programs installed.

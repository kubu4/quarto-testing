One liner to create Docker container for Jupyter notebook usage and data analysis on roadrunner (Xserve):


    



This does the following:




    
  * Maps roadrunner port 8888 to Docker container port 8888 (for Jupyter notebook access outside of the Docker container)

    
  * Mounts my local Jupyter notebooks directory to the

    
    <code>/notebooks</code>


directory in the Docker container

    
  * Mounts my local data directory to the

    
    <code>/data</code>


directory in the Docker container

    
  * Mounts my local analysis directory to the

    
    <code>/analysis</code>


directory in the Docker container



These commands allow me to interact with data outside of the Docker container.

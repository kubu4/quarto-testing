[RNAseq experiment](category/protein-expression-profiles-during-sexual-maturation-in-geoduck.html), which is part of a larger project that involves characterizing geoduck gonad development across multiple stages: histologically, proteomically, and transcriptomically. [Initial sample collection performed by Grace Crandall](https://genefish.wikispaces.com/Grace's+Notebook).

The current status can be seen in the screen cap below. Current release date is set for a year from now, but will likely bump it up. Need Steven to review the details of the submission (BioProject, Experiment descriptions, etc.) before I initiate the public release. Will update this post with the SRA number once we receive it.

Hereâ€™s the list of files uploaded to the SRA:

Geo_Pool_F_GGCTAC_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz
Geo_Pool_F_GGCTAC_L006_R2_001.fastq.gz
Geo_Pool_M_CTTGTA_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz
Geo_Pool_M_CTTGTA_L006_R2_001.fastq.gz

Mate pair sequencing files were uploaded together within a single "Run".

After a bit of a scare this weekend (Synology DX513 expansion unit no longer detected two drives after a system update - resolved by powering down the system and rebooting it), we revisited our approach for backing up data.

Our decision was to utilize UW Google Drive, as it provides unlimited storage space!

Synology has an available app for syncing data to/from Google Drive, so I set up both Owl (Synology DS1812+) and Eagle (Synology DS413) to sync all of their data to a shared UW Google Drive account. This should provide a functional backup solution for the massive amounts of data we're storing and it will simplify tracking where/what is backed up where. Now, instead of wondering if certain directories are backed up via CrashPlan or Backblaze or Time Backup to another Synology server, we know that everything is backed up to Google Drive.

Last week [I downloaded the final BGI data files and assemblies for Olympia oyster and geoduck genome sequencing projects](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2016/2016-12-14-data-management-download-final-bgi-genome-assembly-files.html). However, the output from the download command made the Jupyter Notebook files too large to view and/or upload to GitHub. So, I had to trim the output cells from that notebook in order to render it usable/viewable./

The notebook below details how I did that and also examines the original version of that jumbo notebook to give some idea of what the command outputs were, for posterity.

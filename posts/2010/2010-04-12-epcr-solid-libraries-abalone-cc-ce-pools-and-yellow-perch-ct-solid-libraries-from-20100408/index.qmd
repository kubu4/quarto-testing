Emulsion PCR (ePCR) was performed for the above three mentioned SOLiD libraries using 1.5pM (180 pg/uL) of cDNA, according to the ABI "full scale" ePCR protocol. ePCRs were stored @ 4C until ready for the emulsion breaking step.

Amounts of cDNA used to make dilutions (in 1x Low TE Buffer) of 180pg/uL:

CC (13.8ng/uL): 1.3uL in 100uL

CE (23.01ng/uL): 1.56uL in 200uL

CT (63.8ng/uL): 1.41 in 500uL

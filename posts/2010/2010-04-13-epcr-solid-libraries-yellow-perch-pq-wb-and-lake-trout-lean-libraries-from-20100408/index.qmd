ePCR was performed for the above three mentioned SOLiD libraries using 1.5pM (180 pg/uL) of cDNA, according to the ABI "full scale" ePCR protocol. ePCRs were stored @ 4C until ready for the emulsion breaking step.

Amounts of cDNA used to make dilutions (in 1x Low TE Buffer) of 180pg/uL:

PQ (20.77ng/uL): 4.33uL in 500uL

WB (16.81ng/uL): 2.14uL in 200uL

Lean (53.49ng/uL): 1.68uL in 500uL

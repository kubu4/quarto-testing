Rec'd package from Scott Lindell @ MBL containing 65 screw cap tubes in a white microtube rack. All tubes are tissues in RNA Later (presumably). One sample (MA4-5) was lost during a brief centrifugation to get tissue sample unstuck from top of tube and in to RNA Later solution. The head of the tube snapped off and the entire tube/sample was obliterated in the rotor. Also, it appears as though all the tubes leaked RNA Later solution during transport. Samples were temporarily stored @ 4C and will be catalogued/transferred to -80C.

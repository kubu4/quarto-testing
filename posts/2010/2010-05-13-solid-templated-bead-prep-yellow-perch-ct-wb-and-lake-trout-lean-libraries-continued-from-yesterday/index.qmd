Templated bead preparation was performed according to the "full scale" protocol.

Bead counts are calculated as follows:

Avg bead count x # hemacytometer squares x volume in hemacytometer (uL) x dilution factor = beads/uL x suspension volume (uL) = total beads

Initial Bead counts: (1:200 dilution)

CT: 132, 133, 127, 136 Avg. = 132

WB: 127, 128, 119, 126 Avg. = 125

Lean: 121, 114, 132, 109 Avg. = 119

CT: 132 x 25 x 10 x 200 = 6.6x10^6 beads/uL x 200uL = 1.32x10^9 beads

WB: 125 x 25 x 10 x 200 = 6.25x10^6 beads/uL x 200uL = 1.25x10^9 beads

Lean: 119 x 25 x 10 x 200 = 5.95x10^6 beads/uL x 200uL = 1.19x10^9 beads

Templated Bead counts (1:10 dilution)

CT: 91, 80, 100, 78 Avg. = 87.25

WB: 69, 70, 75, 65 Avg. = 69.75

Lean: 40, 52, 48, 46 Avg. = 46.5

CT: 87.25 x 25 x 10 x 10 = 218125 beads/uL x 400uL = **8.7525x10^7 beads**

WB: 39.75 x 25 x 10 x 10 = 174375 beads/uL x 400uL = **6.975x10^7 beads**

Lean: 46.5 x 25 x 10 x 10 = 116250 beads/uL x 400uL = **4.65x10^7 beads**

Percent Recovery Templated Beads

CT: (8.7252x10^7 beads)/(1.32x10^9 beads) x 100 = **6.61%**

WB: (6.975x10^7 beads)/(1.25x10^9 beads) x 100 = **5.58%**

Lean: (4.65x10^7 beads)/(1.19x10^9 beads) x 100 = **3.91%**

Results: Everything looks pretty darn good. One mild concern, however, is the yield from the the Lean library. An 8-well slide requires 41 million beads for a run. Additionally, I believe 15 million are needed for a WFA (quality check, pre-run). This means that the Lean prep is nearly 10 million beads short of what is necessary for a "complete" run of this sample. Will send the numbers to Rhonda and see what her opinion is and what she suggests to do. But, based on the percent recovery, all the samples should be really high quality (extremely few polyclonal beads).

Rec'd package from Rutgers (Emily Pearson) containing two large Ziplock bags on "wet" ice, each of those containing smaller bags with sample tubes in them. One large bag contains gill tissue samples and the other large bag contains hemolymph samples. Samples will temporarily be stored @ 4C until they can be catalogued and boxed by Lexie later today.

ePCR was performed for the above three mentioned SOLiD libraries using 1.5pM (180 pg/uL) of cDNA, according to the ABI "full scale" ePCR protocol. ePCRs were stored @ 4C until ready for the emulsion breaking step.

Amounts of cDNA used to make dilutions (in 1x Low TE Buffer) of 180pg/uL:

Sisco (42.29 ng/uL): 2.13uL in 500uL

HPWS09 (9.29 ng/uL): 1.94uL in 100uL

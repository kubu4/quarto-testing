RNA was isolated from the following samples using TriReagent, according to protocol:

MAX 1, 2, & 3

CA 1, 2, & 3

MA 1, 2, & 3

Samples were resuspended in 50uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O and spec'd:

Results:

260/280 ratios are decent for most of the samples, with MAX1 and MAX 2 being the exception. Both of these samples also have very poor 260/230 ratios. Out of curiosity, I will EtOH precipitate all samples to see if I can improve both the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios.

Amplified cDNA was cleaned up using the Invitrogen PureLink Micro Kit, but was done so according to Ambion's Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit protocol and then spec'd.

Results:

0.5uL was removed from each sample and mixed with 0.5uL to run on DNA 1000 chips on the Bioanalyzer 2100. The slideshow below shows the electropherograms from each sample. Each sample (to be considered worthy of moving to the next stage) should have <20% of the sample in the 25-150bp range. All 8 samples exhibit this and their peaks look very good. Will proceed to ePCR/templated bead prep next week.

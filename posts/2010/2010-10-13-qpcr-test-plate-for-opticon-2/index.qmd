Ran a full plate for testing well-to-well consistency (or, inconsistency!) of the Opticon 2, since it's been behaving poorly lately. This will provide us with an idea of whether or not the oddities that we've been witnessing have any effect on our actual data.

Used C.gigas gDNA (DH15 from 20100519; 0.5128ug/uL) and IL17 Internal Fw/Rv primers (SR ID: 255, 256), which have previously produced an amplicon with gDNA. [Master mix calcs/plate layout/cycling parameters/etc are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20101012-01.jpg).

DNA was combined in master mix so that all wells received ~100ng of gDNA.

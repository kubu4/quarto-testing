30 gill tissue samples in RNA Later from CA, MA, & MAX each.

30 hemolymph samples (in RNA Later?) from CA, MA, & MAX each.

Presumably these are from the same individuals. Tubes were boxed (a total of 3 boxes), labeled and stored @ -80C.

Here is a [note included from Emily with the samples](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20101015-01.jpg) .

Continued with 2nd round of digestions from yesterday. All samples were resuspended in 25uL of H2O yesterday, so brought volume up to 44uL with H2O, added 5uL of appropriate 10X Buffer (HpaII = NEB Buffer #4, MspI = NEB Buffer #1), added 1uL of enzyme, incubated 37C for 3hrs. Heat-inactivated all samples @ -80C for 30 mins.

# Phenol:Chloroform Extractions



Restriction digestsÂ  were mixed with equal volume (50uL) of phenol:chloroform:IAA (25:24:1) and centrifuged 16,000g for 5mins @ 4C. Aqueous phase was transferred to a clean tube and an equal volume (50uL) of chloroform was added. Samples were mixed and centrifuged 16,000g for 5mins @ 4C. Aqueous phase was transferred to clean tubes and stored @ -20C. Will EtOH precipitate and spec on Monday.

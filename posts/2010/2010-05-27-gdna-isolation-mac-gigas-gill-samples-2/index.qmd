Set up gDNA isolation from the following samples:

R51 01 (WB R051-0410-01)

R51 11 (WB R051-0410-11)

Samples were thawed from -80C. Tissue was removed from RNA Later ([RNA Later gDNA isolation protocol; this protocol doesn't indicate that anything needs to be done to the sample prior to gDNA isolation](https://www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/genomicDNA_rnalater.html)) and ~25mg was cut from each and placed in 0.5mL of DNAzol. 2.7uL of Proteinase K (Fermentas; 18.5mg/mL) was added to each tube to reach a final concentration of 100ug/mL. The digests were incubated O/N @ RT with rotation.

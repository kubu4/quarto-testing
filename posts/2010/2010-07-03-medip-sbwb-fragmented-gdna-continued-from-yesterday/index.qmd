Continued MeDIP process from yesterday. Protein A/G beads were pelleted XXXXXXXXX, supe transferred to clean tube. Beads were washed 3x in the following fashion, each wash saved to retain unmethylated DNA:

1.

Samples were phenol:chloroform extracted and EtOH precipitated:





  1. Added equal volume of phenol:chloroform:IAA, vortexed, spun @ 12,500g, 5mins, 4C.



  2. Transferred aqueous phase to clean tube.



  3. Added equal volume of chloroform, vortexed, spun @ 12,500g, 5mins, 4C.



  4. Transferred aqueous phase to clean tube.



  5. Added 0.1 vols 3M NaOAc (pH=5.2), 2.5 vols of 100% EtOH, mixed and stored @ -20C over the weekend.






Will finish precipitation next week and quantify recovery.

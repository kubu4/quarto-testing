This is an exact repeat of the PCR from yesterday, due to inconsistencies between repeated PCRs from yesterday and earlier today. [Here's yesterday's workup](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091215-02.jpg)

Results:

Gel Loading (from left to right):

Opsin Primers (lanes 2-10), Rhodopsin Primers (same loading order, lanes 12-20)

1 - 100bp ladder

2 - retina

3 - fin

4 - 4th arm

5 - dorsal mantle center

6 - dorsal mantle side

7 - ventral mantle center

8 - ventral mantle side

9 - H2O

10 - H2O

Opsin Primers

Single bands in retina, fin and ventral mantle center samples. Negative controls are clean. Bands will be excised and stored @-20C in Sam's "Purified Inserts" box for eventual sequencing. Tubes are labelled with a "2" to differentiate them from the gel run earlier today.

Rhodopsin Primers

Single bands in retina and fin. Double bands in ventral mantle center sample. Second band is very faint is ~700bp. Negative controls are clean. Bands, including the faint 700bp VMC, will be excised and stored @-20C in Sam's "Purified Inserts" box for eventual sequencing. Tubes are labelled with a "2" to differentiate them from the gel run earlier today.

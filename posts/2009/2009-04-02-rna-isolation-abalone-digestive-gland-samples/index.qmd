Total RNA was isolated from the following abalone digestive gland samples using the RNA Powersoil Kit, according to their protocol:

08:3-17

08:3-18

08:4-2

08:4-3

08:4-4

08:4-5

08:4-7

08:4-8

08:4-11

Notes: 08:4-5 took hours to wash the column. 08:4-4 ended up with a dark RNA pellet and the reuspended RNA is discolored (brown-ish).

Results: All the RNA looks good except for 08:4-4, but that isn't surprising (see note above). Samples were stored @ -80C in the boxes from which the tissue samples came.

The two RNA samples from yesterday were precipitated and washed according to the [Ambion PolyA Purist protocol](https://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Commercial%20Protocols:Manuals/Ambion%20-%20MicroPoly%28A%29Purist%20Kit.pdf) and resuspended in 50uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O.

Results: RNA readings look better than they did prior to precipitation. The hemo RNA samples will be combined with previous hemo RNA samples and mRNA will be isolated using the Ambion PolyA Purist Kit.

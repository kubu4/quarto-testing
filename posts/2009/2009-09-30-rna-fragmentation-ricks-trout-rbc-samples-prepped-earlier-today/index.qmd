#### EtOH Precipitaiton - Rick's trout Ribosomoal-depleted RNA for SOLiD WTK (continued from yesterday)



Continued precipitation. Spun samples 30 mins, 16,000g, 4C. Removed supe. Added 1mL 70% EtOH. Spun samples 15mins, 16,000g, 4C. Removed supe. Resuspended in 8uL H2O. Proceeded with SOLiD WTK fragmentation.





#### RNA Fragmentation



Samples were fragmented according to the Whole Transcriptome Kit protocol. Samples were then cleaned up using Invitrogen's RiboMinus Concentration Module, according to SOLiD WTK protocol. Briefly:




    
  * Added 1X volume of binding buffer (100uL)

    
  * Added 100% EtOH (250uL)

    
  * Eluted with 20uL of H2O.



Samples were spec'd.

Control Sample - Virtually nothing there. Hopefully it's just too dilute for the NanoDrop, however I have a feeling this sample is bad (degraded?) 1.5uL of the sample has been transferred to a 0.5mL snap cap tube to send off for the Bioanalyzer.

Poly I:C Sample - Looks great, excellent recovery. 0.25uL of this sample was transferred to a 0.5mL snap cap tube containing 1.25uL of H2O to send off for the Bioanalyzer.

Samples were stored @ 80C until resutls from the Bioanalyzer are received.

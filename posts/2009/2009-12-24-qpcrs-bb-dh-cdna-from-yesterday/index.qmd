qPCR was set up on these cDNAs using the following primers:

EW778094 ("Ficolin 3") -

AJ422120.p.cg.6 ("MDR49", "Multidrug resistance protein homolog 49") - This was upregulated in DH SOLiD data.

Preliminary results show that the EW778094 primer set looks bad; bad fluorescence profile and poor melt curves. Primers may require optimization.

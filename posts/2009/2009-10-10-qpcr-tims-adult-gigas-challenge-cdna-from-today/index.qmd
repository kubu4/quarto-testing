Set up qPCR with EF1 primers and IL17 Internal primers. [Plate layout/setup is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091009-03.jpg). Note: gDNA sample used as a "positive" control will NOT amplify with the EF1 primers.

Results: Processed with PCR Miner. Normalized to EF1. Standard Error bars. Here is spreadsheet with workup.

Received Hard Clam gill samples on "wet ice" in RNA Later from Rutgers. Samples were collected on 11/4/09 (clams held in refrigerator) and preserved (gill tissue collected) on 11/9/09 [according to the paper included with the samples](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20091113-01.jpg). Samples will be stored @ -80C until we are ready to process.

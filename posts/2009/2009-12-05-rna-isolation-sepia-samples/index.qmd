Isolated RNA from 7 sepia samples received 20091125. Samples were removed from RNA Later, blotted and homogenized in 500uL of TriReagent. 500uL of additional TriReagent was added to the tubes after homogenization. Procedure was followed normally. The sepia retina RNA was isolated separately from the other samples and was resuspended in 100uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O. The remaining samples were isolated and resuspended in 20uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O. Nearly all samples had some sort of purple tint to them, ranging from almost black to extremely faint purple hue. The samples were spec'd and then stored @ -80C in Sam's RNA Box #1.

Nearly all of the samples exhibited very strange curves and mediocre 260/280 ratios (for RNA). Could be due to the "purple stuff" carryover or possibly an effect of the RNA Later from which the samples were stored.

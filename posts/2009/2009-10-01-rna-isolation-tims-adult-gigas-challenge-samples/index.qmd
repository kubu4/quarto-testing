RNA was isolated using 500uL of TriReagent for all samples. Samples were resuspended in 100uL of 0.1%DEPC-H2O and spec'd. Samples stored in Tim's "NAME OF BOX" box.

Results:

AC# = Air Control Sample

CC# = CO2 Control Sample

AV# = Air Vibrio Sample

CV# = CO2 Vibrio Sample

All the samples look really good, even those that exhibited dark coloration carried over from extraction. Will check for gDNA contamination.

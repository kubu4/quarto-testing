### qPCR - BgBL Primers



Set up qPCR with Cv_BgBL_F/R primers. This is a second rep. [Plate layout/PCR set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090630-03.jpg).

Results: Waters are clean. To be analyzed later with other genes that Mac has run.





### qPCR - HMG Primers



Set up qPCR with Cv_HMG_F/R primers. This is a second rep. [Plate layout/PCR set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090630-02.jpg).

Results: Waters are clean. To be analyzed later with other genes that Mac has run.





### qPCR - HSP70 Primers



Set up qPCR with Cv_HSP70_F/R primers. This is a second rep. [Plate layout/PCR set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090630-01.jpg).

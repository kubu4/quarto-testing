Set up qPCR with Cg_HIF1 (hypoxia induced factor 1) primers and prostaglandin E2 primers. [Plate layout/setup is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091012-01.jpg).

Results: Processed with PCR Miner. Normalized to EF1. Standard Error bars. Here is spreadsheet with workup.

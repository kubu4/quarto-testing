Set up qPCR. [Plate layout/workup is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090610-01.jpg).

Results: Looks like gDNA contamination is still present!! This is insane! However, the two water-only samples produced a signal suggesting that something else is contaminated. Will try just qPCR-ing water to see if I can get a clean signal. Will use "store-bought" PCR water instead of NanoPure water.

*UPDATE**: Possibly used 16s universal bacterial primers instead of H.crach 16s primers! Doh! Will re-qPCR using the correct primers.

Performed PCR as set up here using universal bacterial 16s primers (sequences provided by Sara Kelly).

Lane 1 - 100bp ladder

Lane 2- 5/13 DNA

Lane 3 - 5/26 DNA

Lane 4 - H2O

Results: Contamination in the water sample. Hopefully this is just bad technique (never thought I'd say that about myself) and not general, bacterial contamination in the primer stocks, since the stocks (nor the PCR rxns) were prepared steriley. Will repeat.

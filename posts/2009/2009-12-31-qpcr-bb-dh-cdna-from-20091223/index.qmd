qPCR was set up on these cDNAs using the following primers:

FP008495.p.cg.6 ("GSTO1", "Glutathione S-transferase omega-1") - This was upregulated in BB SOLiD data.

These were run in duplicate to take up a full PCR plate. [qPCR set up and plate layout can be found here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091231-01.jpg).

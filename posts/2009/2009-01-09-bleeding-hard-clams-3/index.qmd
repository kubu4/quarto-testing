Bled 24 hard clams using a 23g 1.5 needle on a 3mL syringe. Fluid was gathered and ranged from ~0.4-1.0mL. Hemolymph was transferred to individual 1.5mL snap cap tubes and spun @ 100g for 30mins @ 4C. Most of the supe was removed, but left ~100uL in each tube to avoid disturbing any pellet. Samples were stored @ -80C in the red box wiht previous hard clam hemo samples. Clams were numbered and transferred to a holding tank. Gill and mantle tissue was collected from 10 of the clams. The collected tissue and the rest of the carcasses were stored @ -80C.

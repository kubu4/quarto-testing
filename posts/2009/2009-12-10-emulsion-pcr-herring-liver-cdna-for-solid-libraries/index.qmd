Emulsion PCR was performed with the two inner gel bands cut out earlier today according to the Ambio WTK protocol. PCR was run for 15 cycles. After the PCR, the samples were cleaned up using the Invitrogen PureLink PCR Micro Kit, according to the Ambion WTK protocol. The cleaned up cDNA (referred to as "libraries" from now on) was spec'd prior to running on the Bioanalyzer.

All samples look good EXCEPT for 4L. It has a terrible 260/230 ratio and has a very low concentration, relative to the other three samples. Although not pictured here, the absorbance curve of the 4L sample was extremely poor and broad, unlike the other three samples.

DNased RNA was used for cDNA rxns. [Workup of the amount of RNA used in each rxn (472ng/uL) is here (Google Spreadsheet)(https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzcHdyU1d0MDVMLWphMFdTOHUwVHFqWnc&hl=en), along with previous cDNA batch numbers. [Actual RT master mix set up is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090721-01.jpg). Samples were given to Lisa for qPCR analysis.

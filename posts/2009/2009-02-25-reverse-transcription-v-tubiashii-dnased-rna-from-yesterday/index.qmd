Set up the MMLV RT rxns with random primers using ~833ng DNAsed RNA (prepared yesterday) according to the [Promega MMLV Product Insert](https://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Product%20Information%20Sheets/Promega%20-%20MMLV%20RT.pdf). This procedure is slightly different than what is in our lab protocol for RT rxns. [Here is the workup for the rxns](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090224-1.jpg). cDNA was stored @ -20C in the "Vibrio" box.

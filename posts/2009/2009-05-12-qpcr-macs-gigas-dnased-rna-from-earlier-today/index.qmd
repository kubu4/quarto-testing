Performed qPCR on the DNased oyster RNA from earlier today with Gigas_18s_F/R primers to verify removal of detectable gDNA in the samples, since the qPCR from 20090508 indicated residual gDNA was still present in some of the DNase treated RNA. [Plate layout/set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090512-01.jpg).

Results: Samples BB# 2, 5, 6, 15 still came up as positive for gDNA contamination. These will NOT be used to make cDNA for subsequent qPCRs.

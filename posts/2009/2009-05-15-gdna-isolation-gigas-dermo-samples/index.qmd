Transferred tissue from previously Chelexed samples:

WP3, WP7, WP13, WP14, WP15, CY1 - These all tested negative for virginica gDNA (18s qPCR by Rony on DATE)

CY42, CY36 - These tested positive for virginica gDNA (18s qPCR by Rony on DATE).

Used Qiagen DNeasy Kit. Digested samples for 3 hrs. at 55C in Proteinase K according to protocol.

Results: Horrible. Virtually no DNA in any of these samples. Additionally, the quality of the DNA is atrocious. Not sure what to do now.

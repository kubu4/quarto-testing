Sample was removed from -20C and spun @ 4C, 16,000 x g for 30mins. Supe removed, pellet washed with 1mL 70% EtOH and spun @ 4C, 16,000 x g for 15mins. Supe removed, tube spun briefly and remainder of EtOH removed. Pellet was resuspended in 100uL of 1x TE and spec'd. Sample will be run on a gel according to JGI instructions.

The only thing that could be worse about this gel would be no sample DNA. However, what we see here (the giants smear in middle of the gel is our sample) is completely degraded OR sheared gDNA. That means this gDNA is absolutely useless now. Will start growing more cultures for another massive gDNA isolation.

Set up qPCR with Cv_18s_F/R primers. [Plate layout/PCR set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090626-01.jpg). This is a second rep. Used 1:20 cDNA plate made by Mac as template.

Results: Waters are clean. Still some samples that aren't coming up. Will eventually run those samples using undiluted cDNA. To be analyzed later with other genes that Mac has run.

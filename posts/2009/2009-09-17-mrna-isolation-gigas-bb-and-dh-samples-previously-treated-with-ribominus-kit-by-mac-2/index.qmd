Was given 1ug of each of these two RNA samples and processed them with Promega's PolyA Tract Kit according to protocol. After elution, the samples were EtOH precipitated @ -20C for 30mins, pelleted 30mins 16,000g for 30mins, 4C. Supe removed, RNA washed with 1mL 70% EtOH and spun 15mins 16,000g, 4C. Supe removed. Resusupended in 15uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O and spec'd.

Results: No measurable amount of RNA in either sample. Samples were stored @ -80C.

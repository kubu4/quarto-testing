RNA isolated on 20090116 was precipitated over the weekend @ -20C. Samples were treated according to [Ambion PolyA Purist protocol](https://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Commercial%20Protocols:Manuals/Ambion%20-%20MicroPoly%28A%29Purist%20Kit.pdf) and resuspended in 100uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O. Samples were stored in the red "hard clam" box @ -80C.

Results: 260/280 look good for both gill and hemo samples. 260/230 looks OK for gill, but looks horrible (as usual) for hemos.

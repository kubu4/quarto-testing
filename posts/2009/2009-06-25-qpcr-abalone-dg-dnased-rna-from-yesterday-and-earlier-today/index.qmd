Check Abalone RNA for residual gDNA contamination after DNase treatment. Ran qPCR with H.crach_16s_SYB_F/R primers. [Plate layout/PCR set up here.](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090625-01.jpg)

Results: Still gDNA in virtually every sample! This is totally insane. Will find/design primers that will only amplify gDNA to aid in subsequent analysis...

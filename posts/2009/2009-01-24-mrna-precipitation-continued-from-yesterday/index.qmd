Samples were pelleted and washed with 70% EtOH according to [Ambion PolyA Purist protocol](https://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Commercial%20Protocols:Manuals/Ambion%20-%20MicroPoly%28A%29Purist%20Kit.pdf). Pellets were resuspended in 10uL of The RNA Storage Solution (included in the Ambion PolyA Purist Kit).

Results: The gill mRNA looks great! Good yield and good ratios. Hemocyte mRNA looks kinda rough and a very low yield (which was to be expected).

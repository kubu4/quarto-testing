This is to test (again!) the H.crach_h-1fg_intron primers and obtain a working positive control. This gDNA is from Lisa/Nate. Acquired from them 20090717. Don't know date/method of isolation, but this should be good, recent gDNA. [qPCR plate layout/set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090717-01.jpg). Anneal temp 50C. Ran serial dilutions of the gDNA: undiluted, 1:10 and 1:100.

Results: Signals look good. The undiluted comes up around 30 cycles. Should be able to use it as a positive control for gDNA detection PCRs.

Total RNA was isolated from the following abalone digestive gland samples using the RNA Powersoil Kit, according to their protocol:

08:3-11

08:3-12

08:3-13

08:3-19

08:3-20

08:3-21

08:3-22

08:3-23

Notes: After phase separation, 3-11 and 3-12 had milky/cloudy aqueous phases. These two samples were subjected to another 10min spin @ 2500g, but this spin made no difference in their appearance. Other samples were clear or slightly translucent at worst.

Results: RNA looks great in nearly all of the samples. RNA has been stored @ -80C in the same box from where the tissue was taken.

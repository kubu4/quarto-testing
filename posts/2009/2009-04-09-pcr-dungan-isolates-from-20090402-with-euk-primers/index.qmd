Did PCR with new Euk primers designed by Steven. Should be one step higher taxonomically. [PCR set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090409-03.jpg). Aneal temp 50C.

Lane 1 - Hyperladder

Lane 2 - 19t

Lane 4 - 13t

Lane 6 - 17t

Lane 7 - 100bp ladder

Lane 8 - 1.5t

Lane 10 - 1.2t

Lane 11 - Hyperladder

Lane 12 - 11t

Lane 14 - H5

Lane 15 - 100bp ladder

Lane 16 - 12t

Lane 18 - H2O

Lane 19 - H2O

Laen 20 - Hyperladder

Results: The new EukA/B primers worked wonderfully. The brightest band in each lane was excised and purified using Millipore DA spin columns. These will be stored and sequenced at a later date.

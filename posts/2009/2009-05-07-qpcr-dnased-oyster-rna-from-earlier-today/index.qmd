Performed qPCR on the DNased RNA to with Gigas_18s_F/R primers to verify removal of detectable gDNA in the samples. [Plate layout/set up can be found here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090507-01.jpg).

Results: All samples produced a signal. In retrospect, this is likely due to having too much RNA for the DNase treatment. I proceeded with the DNase treatment and qPCR prior to specing the samples. Spec revealed that most of them were highly concentrated; more than the Ambion protocol recommends. Will redo the DNase treatment on a subset of the samples using the appropriate quantity of RNA.

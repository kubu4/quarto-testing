### qPCR - CIAPIN Primers



Set up qPCR with Cv_CIAPIN_F/R primers. [Plate layout/PCR set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090624-02.jpg).

Results: Waters are clean. gDNA samples did not amplify. To be analyzed later with other genes that Mac has run.





### qPCR - CatY Primers



Set up qPCR with Cv_CatY_F/R primers. [Plate layout/PCR set up is here.](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090624-01.jpg)

Results: Waters are clean. gDNA samples did not amplify. To be analyzed later with other genes that Mac has run.

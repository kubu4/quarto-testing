Due to craziness seen in melting curves, fluorescence, and empty wells from the previous run, will compare SYTO vs. SYBR with select MV cDNAs. Additionally, acquired some qPCR strip caps to use instead of the ABI film. Used Cv_18s_F/R primers. [qPCR set up/plate layout is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090615-03.jpg).

Results: Both seem to work fine. H2O fluorescence is weird, but doesn't come up in the melting curves. Strategene SYBR provides a brighter signal, but results in a higher melting temp than the SYTO.

This is being done to check whether or not there is gDNA contamination in these cDNA and DNased RNA. Will use H.crach_h-1fg_intron primers. gDNA 07:12-15 was used as a positive control, based on results from yesterday's qPCR. [qPCR plate layout/set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090716-01.jpg). Anneal temp 50C.

Results: Everything came up negative, including the positive control! Also, the machine experienced an error at ~cycle 39, so no melting curve info. See below.

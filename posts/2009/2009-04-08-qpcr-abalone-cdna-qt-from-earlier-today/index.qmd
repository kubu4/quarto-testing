qPCR was performed with 16s_sybr primers on a subset of the cDNA rxns and all of the "No RT" rxns from earlier to detect the presence of contaminating gDNA. qPCR was also performed with the Rab7_sybr primers on a subset of the cDNA rxns to check that the assay would work. [The qPCR set up sheet/plate layout is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090408-05.jpg). Annealing temp = 55C.

Results: Apparently the gDNA wipeout step did NOT work! Also, some signal in the water samples.

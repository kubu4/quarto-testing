All samples , except xCVC-11t, are already in Chelex. For xCvC-11t, pipetted a shunk of cells/tissue from source tube. Volume of liquid (EtOH) was ~75uL. Added this to screw cap tube containing 300uL of 10% Chelex solution. Vortexed and incubated @ 95C for 30mins. Vortexed and incubated other samples at 95C for 5mins. Set up PCR with AmpliTaq. Anneal temp. = 53C. [PCR set up here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090107-01.jpg).

Lane 9 - Neg. Control

Results: Ladder is degraded and there are no bands in any lane. Will repeat and try to duplicate Steven's results from 20080916.

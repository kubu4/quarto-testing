Used 5uL of RNA from each sample, brought samples up to 50uL with H2O and treated according to Ambion's Turbo DNA-free kit. Rigorous protocol was followed (1.5uL DNase initially + 1.5uL additional DNase after 30mins). Transferred treated samples to a PCR plate to facilitate further manipulation of the samples. Will perform qPCR on these samples to make sure treatment worked.

Started two 100mL cultures in 1x Marine Broth + biphenyl. One culture was inoculated from the original liquid culture (from [20090419](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan-May+2009#sjw20090419)) and the second was inoculated with a thick loopfull of C. pugetti from the plate (from [20090424](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan-May+2009#sjw20090424)). Cultures were incubated @ 28C, 200RPM.

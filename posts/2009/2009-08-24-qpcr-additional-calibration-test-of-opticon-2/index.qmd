Based on recs from Bio-Rad rep (Carl Fisher), will repeat Opticon 2 calibration (see [20090813](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jun-Aug+2009#sjw20090813)) test according to Opticon manual. Then, will rotate plate 180 degrees and repeat test and upload data to Bio-Rad server for analysis and evaluation.

Results: According to the Bio-Rad rep, he thinks recalibration is in order. He pointed out that we're seeing a 3-fold spread in fluorescence, which is outside of the "tolerable" range (which is 2-fold). Will recalibrate.

Used up the remainder of the one positive control gDNA that worked with all the primers in yesterday's reaction (H.crach_h-1fg_intron, H.iris_actin_intron, H.crach_16s), so need to find a new set of gDNA to use for future positive controls. [qPCR plate layout/set up is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090715-01.jpg). Anneal temp 50C. Used the following gDNA with :

06:50-9 - This was the good gDNA used as previous controls. Added 10uL of H2O to the tube in hopes of getting more useable DNA.

06:4-7 - No date/info available on tube.

07:12-15 - No date/info available on tube.

Results: Got decent signals with the H.crach_h-1fg primers for two of the three gDNAs. Will use the 07:12-15 gDNA as a positive control for tomorrow's qPCR.

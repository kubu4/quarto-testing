Set up qPCR with Cg_P450 primers and TNFRAF3'/5' primers. [Plate layout/setup is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091013-02.jpg).

Results: Processed with PCR Miner. Normalized to EF1. Standard Error bars. Here is spreadsheet with workup.

**P450**: The two control samples (AC & CC) show significant difference in expression between the Air and CO2 treated samples. The Vibrio treated samples (AV & CV) show no difference in expression between Air and CO2 treatments.

The Air samples (AC & AV) show significant difference in expression between the Control (AC) and Vibrio treated (AV) samples.

**TNFRAF3**: Expression levels of the Vibrio treated samples (AV &CV) were too low for Miner processing.

There are significant differences in expression between the Air (AC) and CO2 treated (CC) samples.

**IkB**:

No difference in expression between Air (AC & AV) and CO2 (CC & CV) treatments.

Appears to be a significant difference between the Air Control (AC) and the Air Vibrio treated (AV) samples.

**Prx6**:

Significant difference in expression between Air Control (AC) and CO2 Control (CC) samples, but no difference in the Vibrio treated samples.

Significant difference in expression between the Air Control (AC) and the Air Vibrio treated (AV) samples, but no difference in the CO2 treated Vibrio samples (CC & CV).

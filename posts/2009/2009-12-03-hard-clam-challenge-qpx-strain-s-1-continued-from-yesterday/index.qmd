All clams appeared to be alive and well. Most had their siphons out when I arrived to start collecting tissues. Clams were shucked after 24hr challenge. Gill and mantle samples were collected in separate 1.5mL snap cap tubes, stored briefly on ice and transferred to -80C in "Hard Clam QPX Challenge 12/2/2009." box.

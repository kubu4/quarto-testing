We previously sent some geoduck samples to Illumina, [as part of a pilot project for them to test out a new sequencing platform](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2017/2017-01-05-sample-submission-geoduck-gdna-for-illumina-pilot-sequencing-project.html). The data has finally arrived!/

It was sent on a 4TB Seagate external hard drive.

Due to weird connection issues we've recently encountered with our server, Owl (Synology DS1812+), I connected the HDD directly to Owl via USB (instead of connecting to a computer and transferring). I transferred the data using the Synology web interface to avoid any computer/NAS connection issues that might interrupt the transfer.

We have a meeting with the Illumina people tomorrow afternoon to review the data they've provided (looks like it's going to take awhile, though). Once that meeting takes place, we'll figure out how to document this project in our data management plan.

[The HDD we received from Illumina last week](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2017/07/31/data-received-geoduck-genome-sequencing-by-illumina.html) only had data (i.e. fastq files) from the NovaSeq runs they performed - nothing from either the MiSeq, nor the HiSeq runs.

We contacted them about the missing data, they confirmed it was missing, and uploaded the remaining data to BaseSpace.

Began downloading the data - will take awhile...

Files will be temporarily stored in these locations:

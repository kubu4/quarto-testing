For [Pub-a-thon 2017](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/wiki/Pub-a-thon-2017), Steven has asked us to put together a 14 day plan for our manuscripts.

My manuscript is accessible in three locations:

Current: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mqbbvmwxhncg) for final editing/formatting before submission [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/).

Additionally, I have established a data repository with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) at [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/j8rc2/)

Here's what I have going on:



#### Day 1







  * Convert .xls data records to .csv to see if they will render in OSF repo. 


  * Assemble figure: phylogenetic tree. 


  * Add figure to manuscript.


  * Deal with any minor edits.





#### Day 2







  * Assemble figure: Puget Sound map. 


  * Add figure to manuscript. 


  * Deal with any minor edits.





#### Day 3







  * Submit? Depends on what Steven's availability is to finish of Background & Summary and write up Abstract.

[An earlier attempt at submitting these files failed.](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2017/03/20/data-management-sra-submission-oly-gbs-batch-submission-fail.html)

I re-uploaded the failed files (indicated in my previous notebook entry linked above) and tried again.

It failed again, despite having successfully uploaded just minutes before.

I re-uploaded that "missing" file and tried again.

This time, it succeeded (and no end-of-stream error for the 1SN_1A file!)!

Will post here with the SRA accession number once it goes live!

I figured it'd be prudent to collect some Eastern oyster (_Crassotrea virginica_) to have around the lab.

I used one of the _C.virginica_ oysters that I picked up Taylor on 20171210 for sampling.

Sampled:





  * Upper mantle (avoided area that was near gonad/white-ish)


  * Ctenidia


  * Lower mantle


  * Muscle


  * Gonad



Samples were transferred to 1.7mL snap cap tubes, frozen on dry ice, and stored @ [-80C in Rack 13, Col 1, Row 5](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qsvz3QTURlPF_hX05BQxjom3484WuMfqQ1ILl9LEljU/edit?usp=sharing).

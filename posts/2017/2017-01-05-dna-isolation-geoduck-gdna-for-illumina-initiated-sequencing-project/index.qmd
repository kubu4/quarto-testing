[We were previously approached by Cindy Lawley (Illumina Market Development) for possible participation in an Illumina product development project, in which they wanted to have some geoduck tissue and DNA on-hand in case Illumina green-lighted the use of geoduck for testing out the new sequencing platform on non-model organisms](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2016/2016-12-21-dna-isolation-geoduck-gdna-for-potential-illumina-initiated-sequencing-project.html). Well, guess what, Illumina has give the green light for sequencing our geoduck! However, they need at least 4μg of gDNA, so I'm isolating more./

Isolated DNA from ctenidia tissue from the same _Panopea generosa_ individual used for the BGI sequencing efforts. [Tissue was collected by Brent & Steven on 20150811](https://onsnetwork.org/halfshell/2015/08/11/big-day-big-clam/).

Used the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit (Omega) to isolate DNA from five separate ~60mg pieces of ctenidia tissue according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with the following changes:




    
  * Samples were homogenized with plastic, disposable pestle in 350μL of ML1 Buffer

    
  * Incubated homogenate at 60C for 1hr

    
  * No optional steps were used

    
  * Performed three rounds of 24:1 chloroform:IAA treatment

    
  * Eluted each in 50μL of Elution Buffer and pooled into a single sample



Quantified the DNA using the Qubit dsDNA BR Kit (Invitrogen). Used 1μL of DNA sample.

Concentration = 162ng/μL (Quant data is here [Google Sheet]: [20170105_gDNA_geoduck_qubit_quant](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BlTd-weYoZCDyhR99OZRdtD5n8ySe2baKjeRepmhvNM/edit?usp=sharing)

Yield is great (total = ~32μg).

Evaluated gDNA quality (i.e. integrity) by running 162ng (1μL) of sample on 0.8% agarose, low-TAE gel stained with ethidium bromide.

Used 5μL of O’GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (ThermoFisher).



Results:

DNA looks good: bright high molecular weight band, minimal smearing, and minimal RNA carryover (seen as more intense "smear" at ~500bp).

Will send off 10μg (they only requested 4μg) so that they have extra to work with in case they come across any issues.

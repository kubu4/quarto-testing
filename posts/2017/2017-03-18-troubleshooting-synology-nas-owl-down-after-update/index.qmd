TL;DR - Server didn't recover after firmware update last night. "Repair" is an option listed in the web interface, but I want to confirm with Synology what will happen if/when I click that button...

The data on Owl is synced here (Google Drive): [UW Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzKkDWZ6tIK4eXV4VFB3VHN2ZUk)

However, not all of Owl was fully synced at the time of this failure, so it seems like a decent amount of data is not accessible. Inaccessible data is mostly from individual user directories.

All high-throughput sequencing is also backed up to Amazon Glacier, so we do have all of that data.



Here is what happened, in chronological order:






    
  1. Updated DSM via web interface in "Update & Restore". Did NOT perform manual install.

    
  2. System became inaccessible via web interface and Synology Assistant.

    
  3. The physical unit showed blue, flashing power light and green flashing LAN1 light.

    
  4. No other lights were illuminated (this includes no lights for any of the drive bays).

    
  5. The attached expansion unit (DX513) showed steady blue power light, steady green lights on all drive bays, and steady green eSATA light.

    
  6. I powered down both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  7. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  8. Both units returned to their previous status and were still inaccessible via the web interface and Synology Assistant.

    
  9. I powered down both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  10. I removed all drives from both units.

    
  11. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  12. I connected to the DS1812+ via Synology Assistant. A message indicated "No Hard Disk Found on 1812+".

    
  13. I powered down both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  14. I added a single HDD to the DS1812+.

    
  15. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  16. I connected to the DS1812+ via Synology Assistant. I was prompted to install the latest DSM. I followed the steps and created a new admin account. Now the system shows 7 drives in the DS1812+ with a message: "System Partition Failed; Healthy". Disk 1 shows a "Normal" status; this is the disk that I used to re-install DSM in Step 14. Additionally, the system shows one unused disk in the DX513.

    
  17. I powered down both units via the web interface.

    
  18. I removed Disk 1 from DS1812+.

    
  19. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  20. The DS1812+ returns to its initial state as described in Step 3.

    
  21. I powered down both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  22. I returned Disk 1 to its bay.

    
  23. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.

    
  24. There's an option to "Repair" the Volume, but I'm not comfortable doing so until I discuss the in/outs of this with Synology. Submitted a tech support ticket with Synology.



Below are pictures of the entire process, for reference.

Notice, the drive light is green and the "Status" light is amber. This is actually an improvement over what I saw when I arrived.[/caption]

This "Formatting system partition" message might be related to the eventual error message that I see ("System Partition Failed") after this is all set up...[/caption]

This does not bode well, since this is behaving like a brand new installation (i.e. no record of the previous configuration, users, etc.).[/caption]

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="700"]![](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/IMG_20170318_085956.jpg)(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/IMG_20170318_085956.jpg) Physically, the drives all look fine (green lights on all drive bays), despite the indication in the DSM about "System Partition Failed" for all of them (except Disk 1). The expansion unit's bay lights are actually all green, but were actively being read at the time of picture (i.e. flashing) so the image didn't capture all of them being green. Amber light on expansion unit reflects what was seen in the DSM - the middle drive is "Not initialized". Note, the drive is actually inserted, but the handle has been released.[/caption]

Notice that after rebooting, the expansion unit no longer shows that "Not initialized" message for Disk 3. Instead, Disk 3 is now detected as installed, but not used...[/caption]

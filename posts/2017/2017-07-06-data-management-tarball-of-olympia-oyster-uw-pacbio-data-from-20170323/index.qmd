[I'd previously attempted to archive this data set](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2017/07/03/data-management-olympia-oyster-uw-pacbio-data-from-20170323.html) on multiple occasions, across multiple days, but network dropouts kept killing my connection to the server (Owl) and, in turn, interrupting the tarball operation.

Today, I came in to a successful creation of the tarball of this PacBio data set (it only took 10hrs)! And, it's a big file: 162GB!! Remember, that's the compressed size!

Now, we'll have to decide where we want to keep the tarball. I guess this'll be part of our next data management plan discussions.

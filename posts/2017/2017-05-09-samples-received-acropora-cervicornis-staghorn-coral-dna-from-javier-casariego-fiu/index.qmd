Received 62 coral (_Acropora cervicornis_) DNA samples from Javier Casariego at FIU.

Spreadsheet of samples and NanoDrop concentrations provided by Javier (converted to Google Sheet): [A.cervicornis_DNA_Extractions(May_2017).xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOZI7LkzBx6tm0RsQQicRNOCKMf83wZb4CMWcdukXgQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Samples were temporarily stored at 4c (in FTR 213) until I can perform global methylation assessment on them tomorrow.

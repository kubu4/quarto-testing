Data, data, data! That is the theme for this month.

**Olympia oyster data** - Going to assess and continue working on assembly the Olympia oyster genome we have from our BGI sequencing project, along with the PacBio data we have. To-date, it's been difficult to get these two datasets to play nicely with one another. I'll take a look to see what's worked, and what hasn't, as well as try out some other means by which to get a decent assembly.

**Geoduck data** - [We just got back an insane amount of RNAseq and genome sequencing data from an Illumina pilot project](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2017/2017-07-31-data-received-geoduck-genome-sequencing-by-illumina.html). This data needs to be properly documented and catalogued./

**Hackweek 2017** - Although this is only a brief period during this month, it's designed to tackle some lower priority tasks that will help streamline lab operations. Check out [the GtiHub repo issues](https://github.com/RobertsLab/2017-hackweek/issues) for Hackweek 2017 to get an idea of some of the projects.

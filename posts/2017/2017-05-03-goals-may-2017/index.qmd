A day late, but definitely not a dollar short!

No goals posted last month because I didn't want anyone to think they were just an April Fool's joke. ;)

This month my goal is to continue my domination of [Pub-a-Thon 2017](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/wiki/Pub-a-thon-2017)!




I plan on doing so by getting a _second_ paper submitted this month! That's right! I'm working on getting the following paper re-submitted:

_[Differential response to stress in Ostrea lurida (Carpenter 1864)(https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-Olurida-gene)_

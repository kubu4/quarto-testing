[Three samples (of the 62 total) that were quantified earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2017/05/10/dna-quantification-acropora-cervicornis-staghorn-coral-dna-from-javier-casariego-fiu.html), had concentrations too low for use in the methylation assay:




    
  * 2h Block 1

    
  * 2h Block 8

    
  * D35 Block 8



These samples were dried to completion in a SpeedVac.

They will be allowed to rehydrate O/N in 10uL of Buffer EB (Qiagen) and will be re-quantified tomorrow morning.

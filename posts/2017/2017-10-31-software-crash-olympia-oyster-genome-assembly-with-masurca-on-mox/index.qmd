Ah, the joys of bioinformatics. I just received an email from Mox indicating that [the Masurca assembly I started 11 DAYS AGO (!!)(2017/10/19/genome-assembly-olympia-oyster-illumina-pacbio-reads-using-masurca.html) crashed.

I'm probably not going to put much effort in to trying to figure out what went wrong, but here's some log file snippets for reference. I'll probably drop a line to the developers and see if they have any easy ways to address whatever caused the problems, but that's about as much effort as I'm willing to put into troubleshooting this assembly.

Additionally, since this crashed, I'm not going to bother moving any of the files off of Mox. That means they will be deleted automatically by the system around Nov. 9th, 2017.

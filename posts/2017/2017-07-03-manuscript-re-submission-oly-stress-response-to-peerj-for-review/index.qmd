[Last August, we made our initial submission of this paper](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2016/2016-08-18-manuscript-submission-oly-stress-response-to-peerj-for-review.html) to [PeeJ](https://peerj.com/)./

Today, we re-submitted the revised manuscript.

The [repo for this paper is here.](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-Olurida-gene)

I've also submitted an updated pre-print. I will update this post when it is publicly accessible (it has to be approved by PeerJ staff before it becomes public).

UPDATE 20170703 - Updated pre-print is now available: [https://peerj.com/preprints/1595/](https://peerj.com/preprints/1595/)

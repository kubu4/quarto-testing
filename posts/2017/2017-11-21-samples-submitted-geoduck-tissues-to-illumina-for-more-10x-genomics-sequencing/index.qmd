Continuing Illumina's generous efforts to use our geoduck samples to test out the robustness of their emerging sequencing technologies, they have requested we send them some more geoduck tissue so that they can try to isolate higher molecular weight DNA to complete the genome sequencing efforts using the 10x genomics sequencing platform.

I sent three frozen pieces of geoduck foot, ctenidia, & adductor muscle tissue on dry ice. [Tissue was collected by Brent & Steven on 20150811](https://onsnetwork.org/halfshell/2015/08/11/big-day-big-clam/).

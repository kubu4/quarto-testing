Ran the four Tanner crab RNA samples that [I isolated yesterday](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2018/2018-07-31-rna-isolation-tanner-crab-hemolymph-using-rneasy-plus-mini-kit.html) on the Seeb Lab Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) using the RNA Pico 6000 Kit./

Samples were run following kit protocol:





  * Chip priming station in Position C with syringe clip at top position



  * RNA denatured at 70C for 2mins and stored on ice.



  * RNA ladder aliquot was from 20160826 by Hollie Putnam.

These results look great to me. Clear, defined peaks/bands, representing ribosomal RNA.

Oddly, one sample (crab_506) appears to be shifted, relative to the other three, despite exhibiting the same peak/banding pattern. Not sure what would cause something like this; contaminants?

Regardless, we finally have clean RNA and have a usable Bioanalyzer profile to use for reference for crab RNA.

NOTE: The lanes marked with red on the gel representation image indicate that a ribosomal integrity number (RIN) could not be calculated. This is to be expected! The RIN is based on the expectation of two rRNA bands. The anomaly is sample crab_451 - a RIN was actually determined for that sample!

Will likely move forward with additional RNA isolations using the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen).

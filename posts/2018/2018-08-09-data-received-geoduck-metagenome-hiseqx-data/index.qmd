FastQ files are being transferred to [owl/nightingales/P_generosa](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_generosa/).

These aren't geoduck sequences, but they are part of a geoduck project. Maybe I should establish a metagenomics directory under `nightingales`?

Will verifiy md5 checksums and update readme file once the transfer is complete.

[After confirming Ronit's DNased RNA was free of gDNA](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/11/15/qPCR-Ronit's-DNased-C.gigas-RNA-with-Elongation-Factor-Primers.html), I quantified the [DNased RNA from 20181115](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/11/15/DNase-Ronit's-C.gigas-Ctenidia-RNA.html) using the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 and the Qubit hsRNA Assay.

Used 1uL of each sample.

#### RESULTS

Qubit data (Google Sheet):

- [20181120_qubit_DNased_RNA_ronit_gigas_ctenidia](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoz9u7fwTEDxz7osmjYWU_EWsS8XZjJe_KfTbeu7eRA/edit?usp=sharing)

Well, 14 samples were too concentrated and exceeded the assay's range, so I created 1:10 dilutions of those samples (1ul of sample in 9uL of 0.1%DEPC-treated H<sub>2</sub>O) and remeasured; again using 1uL of sample.

Admittedly, I'm not terribly surprised that happened, since they were notably lower than Ronit's first round of RNA isolations.

I added the data to his master sheet (Google Sheet):

- [Exposure 8/29-8/30 C.Gigas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17mv8gMbmaldggA8Zf0RwBeNF_O4faY8dJFg31XO63K4/edit?usp=sharing)

I will proceed with making cDNA.

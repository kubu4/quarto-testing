Continued MBD enrichment for _C.virginica_ and Qiagen project [from yesterday](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/01/08/mbd-enrichment…ared-dna-day-1.html).

Followed the MethylMiner Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit (Invitrogen) manufacturer's protocol for input DNA amounts of 1 -10ug (I am using 8ug in each of two samples).

Performed a single, high-salt elution.

Samples were precipitated O/N @ -80C.

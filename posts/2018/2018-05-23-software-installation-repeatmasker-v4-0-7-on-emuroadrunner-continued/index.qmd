[After yesterday's difficulties getting RMblast to compile](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/05/22/software-installation-repeatmasker-v4-0-7-on-emuroadrunner.html), I deleted the folder and went through the build process again.

This time it worked, but it did _not_ put rmblastn in the specified location (`/home/shared/rmblast`).

This fact took me a fair amount of time to figure out. Finally, after a couple of different re-builds, I ran `find` to see if rmblastn existed somewhere I wasn't looking:

Additionally, I couldn't find the location of the various BLAST executables. Some internet sleuthing led me to the [NCBI page on installing BLAST+ from source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279671/), which indicates that the executables are stored in:


    
    <code>ncbi-blast-VERSION+-src/c++/ReleaseMT/bin/</code>



How intuitive! /s

In order to improve readability and usability of the `/home/shared/` directory, I renamed the `/home/shared/rmblast` directory to reflect the BLAST version and created a symbolic link in that directory to the `rmlbastn` executable:

##### Specify TRF install location:

##### Hmmm, TRF error. Looking for file called `trf`:

##### Renamed TRF file to `trf` and now it's automatically found:

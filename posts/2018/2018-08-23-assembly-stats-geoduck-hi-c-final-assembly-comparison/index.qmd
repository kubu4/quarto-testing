We received the final geoduck genome assembly data from Phase Genomics, in which they updated the assembly by performing some manual curation:





  * [geoduck_manual_scaffolds.fasta](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180822_phase_genomics_geoduck_Results/geoduck_manual/geoduck_manual_scaffolds.fasta)



There are additional assembly files that provide some additional assembly data. See the following directory:



  * [20180822_phase_genomics_geoduck_Results/geoduck_manual/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180822_phase_genomics_geoduck_Results/geoduck_manual/)



Actual sequencing data and two previous assemblies were [previously received on 20180421](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2018/2018-04-21-data-management-geoduck-phase-genomics-hi-c-data.html)./

All assembly data (both old and new) from Phase Genomics was downloaded in full from the Google Drive link provided by them and stored here on Owl:





  * [20180822_phase_genomics_geoduck_Results/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180822_phase_genomics_geoduck_Results/)



Ran Quast to compare all three assemblies provided (command run on Swoose):

Quantified _Crassostrea virginica_ MBD-enriched DNA [from earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2018/2018-01-10-mbd-enrichmentâ€¦ared-dna-day-3.html) for Qiagen project./

Used the Qubit 3.0 (ThermoFisher) and the Qubit dsDNA Broad Range (BR) Kit (ThermoFisher).

Used 1uL of template DNA.

Results:

Quantification Spreadsheet (Google Sheet): [20180110_qubit_dsDNA_BR_MBD_virginica](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HVwlkcCn2AmhJQAHbP4GYSD-V4-ZnahiD55kc9PdjYs/edit?usp=sharing)

Both samples had decent yields and have usable quantities for Qiagen (they wanted ~300ng from each sample):

virginica_MBD_01 - 18.3ng/uL (457.5ng = 5.7% methylated DNA capture)

virginica_MBD_02 - 19.6ng/uL (490ng = 6.1% methylated DNA capture)

Will store @ -20C until next week so that we're not shipping so close to the weekend (shipping address is in Germany).

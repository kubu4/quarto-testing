Yesterday, [I annotated our Olympia oyster genome using WQ-MAKER in just 7hrs!](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/08/07/genome-annotation-olympia-oyster-genome-using-wq-maker-instance-on-jetstream.html).

See that link for run setup and configuration. They are essentially the same, except for the change I'll discuss below.

The results from that run can be seen here:





  * [Genome Annotation – Olympia oyster genome annotation results #01](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/08/08/genome-annotation-olympia-oyster-genome-annotation-results-01.html)



In that previous run, I neglected to provide a transposable elements FastA file for use with RepeatMasker.

I remedied that and re-ran it. I modified [`maker_opts.ctl`](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180807_wqmaker_run_oly_02/maker_opts.ctl) to include the following:



    <code>repeat_protein=../../opt/maker/data/te_proteins.fasta #provide a fasta file of transposable element proteins for RepeatRunner</code>



This TEs file is part of RepeatMasker.

This run took about an hour longer than [the previous run](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/08/07/genome-annotation-olympia-oyster-genome-complete-brief-note.html), but for some reason it ran with only 21 workers, instead of 22. This is probably the reason for the increased run time.

I'd like to post a snippet of the GFF file here, but the line lengths are WAY too long and will be virtually impossible to read in this notebook. The GFF consists of listing a "parent" contig and its corresponding info (start/stop/length). Then, there are "children" of this contig that show various regions that are matched within the various databases that were queried, i.e. repeatmasker annotations for identifying repeat regions, protein2genome for full/partial protein matches, etc. Thus, a single scaffold (contig) can have dozens or hundreds of corresponding annotations!

Probably the easiest and most logical to start working with will be those scaffolds that are annotated with a "protein_match", as these have a corresponding GenBank ID. Parsing these out and then doing a join with NCBI protein IDs will give us a basic annotaiton of "functional" portions of the genome.

Additionally, we should probably do some sort of comparison of this run with the previous run where I did _not_ provide the transposable elements FastA file.

[We previously received sea lice (_Caligus tape_) DNA](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/05/23/dna-received-sea-lice-dna-from-cris-gallardo-escarate-at-universidad-de-concepcion.html) from Cris Gallardo-Escarate at Universidad de Concepci√≥n.

[Steven asked that I quantify and assess the DNA quality](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/373).

Ran the samples on the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 using the dsDNA BR assay (Invitrogen) and 1uL of template DNA.

Ran the samples on the Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000 to get 260/280 values for quality assessment using 2uL of template DNA. NanoDrop1000 was blanked with water, but I don't know what solvent the DNA is currently resuspended in.

DNA looks super clean. Not sure what this DNA is intended for so can't speculate much on what the implications might be for the concentrations on downstream usage.

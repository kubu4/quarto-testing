Here we are - my new notebook!


So, I moved things over to here: GitHub Pages. Everyone else in the lab has been using these for quite some time.

It took me a bit of time to get everything configured, as I wanted to use a theme, instead of the default "jekyll-now" theme that everyone has has used. This theme ([Basically Basic](https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/)) had all of the features that I felt I needed:

- Built-in search

- Tag organization

- Project (i.e. Categories) organization

- Display post date alongside the post excerpt

Getting things up and running just to begin posting wasn't terribly difficult. I set things up using the "remote themes guide" found in the [Basically Basic](https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/) documentation.

I'll have to manually transfer the content of those two posts.


I wrote the following script to do that conversion:


Although that script looks short and sweet, it took an inordinate amount of time to make it functional (I really got hung up on the regex in the ```grep``` command). I had to post to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53213379/grep-o-multiple-occurrences-of-variable-string-in-same-line) to get it figured out.

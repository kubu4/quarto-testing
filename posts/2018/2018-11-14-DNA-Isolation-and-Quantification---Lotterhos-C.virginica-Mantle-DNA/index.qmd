Isolated DNA from the [Lotterhos _Crassostrea virginica_ mantle samples received on 20181017](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/10/17/samples-received-crassostrea-virginica-eastern-oyster-tissue-from-lotterhos-lab-northeastern-university.html) using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit, with the following modifications/notes:

- Samples were pulverized under liquid nitrogen.
- Samples were incubated O/N at 37<sup>o</sup>C in the MB1/Proteinase K buffer mixture.
- 270uL of aqueous phase was recovered from each sample after chloroform:IAA step.
- Samples were eluted with 100uL of Elution Buffer.

All samples were quantified using the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 and the Qubit dsDNA BR Kit, using 1uL of template.

All samples were stored at -20<sup>o</sup>C, in [Sam's gDNA Box #3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16n4LzVNXrMd3fYRHN4UR4CQ67yRXwlJfDiAmbxD284g/edit?usp=sharing) in slots A1-C6.

#### RESULTS

Yields were very good, ranging from ~2.8ug - 20ug.

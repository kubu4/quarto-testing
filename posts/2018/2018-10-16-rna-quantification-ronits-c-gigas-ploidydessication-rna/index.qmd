Last Friday, Ronit quantified 1:10 dilutions of the RNA [I isolated on 20181003](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/10/03/rna-isolation-ronits-c-gigas-diploidtriploid-dessicationheat-shock-ctenidia-tissues.html) and the RNA [he finished isolating on 20181011](https://genefish.wordpress.com/2018/10/11/ronits-notebook-rna-extraction-day-2/), but two of the samples (D11-C, T10-C) were still too concentrated.

I made 1:20 dilutions (1uL RNA in 19uL 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O) and quantified them using the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0, with the RNA HS assay. Used 1uL of the diluted RNA.

#### RESULTS



Qubit data (Google Sheet):





  * [20181016_qubit_Cgigas_RNA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19S2yFspWZLClwsmu7_3osrAOA5-2RemZ_-OjKB1OZpI/edit?usp=sharing)



Everything looks good. Added final concentration values (Qubit data x 20, to account for dilution factor) to Ronit's master sheet (Google Sheet):

Will proceed with DNasing.

After [quantifying Ronit's RNA earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2018/2018-10-16-rna-quantification-ronits-c-gigas-ploidydessication-rna.html), I DNased them using the Turbo DNA-free Kit (Ambion), according to the [manufacturer's standard protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Ambion_Turbo_DNA_Free.pdf)./

Used 1000ng of RNA in a 50uL reaction in a 0.5mL thin-walled snap cap tube. Samples were mixed by finger flicking and then incubated 30mins @ 37oC in a PTC-200 thermal cylcer (MJ Research), without a heated lid.

DNase inactivation was performed (0.1 volumes of inactivation reagent; 5uL), pelleted, and supe transferred to new 1.7mL snap cap tube.

Samples were stored on ice in preparation for qPCR to test for residual gDNA.

Samples will be permanently stored here (Google Sheet):

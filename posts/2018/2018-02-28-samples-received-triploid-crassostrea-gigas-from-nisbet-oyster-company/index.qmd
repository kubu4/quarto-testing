Received a bag of Pacific oysters from Nisbet Oyster Company.

Four oysters were shucked and the following tissues were collected from each:





  * ctenidia


  * gonad


  * mantle


  * muscle



Utensils were cleaned and sterilized in a 10% bleach solution between oysters.

Tissues were stored briefly on wet ice and then stored at -80C in [Rack 2, Column 3, Row 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qsvz3QTURlPF_hX05BQxjom3484WuMfqQ1ILl9LEljU/edit?usp=sharing)

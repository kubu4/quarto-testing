Today we received the whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) from the [24 _C.gigas_ diploid-triploid samples subjected to different pH that were submitted 20200824](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2020/2020-08-24-Sample-Submitted-C.gigas-Diploid-Triploid-pH-Treatments-Ctenidia-to-ZymoResearch-for-WGBS.html). The lengthy turnaround time was due to a bad lot of reagents, which forced them Zymo to find a different manufacturer in order to generate libraries./

Sequencing consisted of WGBS 150bp paired end (PE) reads for each library. All files were downloaded to the [`C_gigas` folder on Owl](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/C_gigas/)(Synology server). MD5 checksums were confirmed:

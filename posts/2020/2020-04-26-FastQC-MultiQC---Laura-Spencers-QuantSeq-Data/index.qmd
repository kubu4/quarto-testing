Laura Spencer received her [_O.lurida_ QuantSeq data](https://laurahspencer.github.io/LabNotebook/Oly-QuantSeq-sequencing/), so I put it through FastQC/MultiQC and put the pertinent info in the [nightingales Google Sheet](http://b.link/nightingales). I also moved the data to [`/owl/nightingales/O_lurida`](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/O_lurida/), updated the readme file and checksums file. There were 148 individual samples, so I won't list them all here.

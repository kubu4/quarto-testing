Earlier today, [I isolated gDNA from _C.bairdi_ 20102558-2729 ethanol-preserved muscle tissue using the Quick DNA/RNA MicroPrep Plus Kit (ZymoResearch)](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/01/22/DNA-Isolation-C.bairdi-20102558-2729-EtOH-preserved-Tissue-via-Three-Variations-Using-Quick-DNA-RNA-MicroPrep-Kit.html) and prepared the tissue in three different ways to see how they would compare:

Ran 10uL of each sample on a 0.8% agarose, 1x low TAE gel with ethidium bromide.

Used the GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (ThermoFisher) as ladder.

#### RESULTS

Ladder:

From left to right, gel was loaded:

- Ladder

- "damp" sample prep

- "dry" sample prep

- "minced" sample prep

Well, all three preps look the same - very degraded. This is virtually the same as what I saw using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit (Omega). Looke like we'll have to pursue a different route to get high quality gDNA for long read sequencing.

Will talk to Grace to see if we have extra hemolymph samples in RNAlater that I can try to get gDNA from and see if that gDNA looks any better.

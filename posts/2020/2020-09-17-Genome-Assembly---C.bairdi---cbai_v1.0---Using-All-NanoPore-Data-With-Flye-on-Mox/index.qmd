After [quality filtering the _C.bairdi_ NanoPore data earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/09/17/Data-Wrangling-C.bairdi-NanoPore-Quality-Filtering-Using-NanoFilt-on-Mox.html), I performed a _de novo_ assembly using [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) on Mox.

SBATCH script (GitHub):

#### RESULTS

Runtime was very fast; just over 1hr!

![Flye runtime for C.bairdi Q7 NanoPore assembly](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200917_cbai_flye_nanopore_genome_assembly_runtime.png?raw=true)

Output folder:

- [20200917_cbai_flye_nanopore_genome_assembly/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200917_cbai_flye_nanopore_genome_assembly/)

Genome Assembly (FastA; 19MB)

- [20200917_cbai_flye_nanopore_genome_assembly/cbai_genome_v1.0.fasta](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200917_cbai_flye_nanopore_genome_assembly/cbai_genome_v1.0.fasta)

  - MD5 checksum (text):

    - `2f3b651bb0b875b0287e71e315cad59a`

NOTE: The output files were named `assembly_*`. At the time I ran this, I didn't realize that was the case, so I had to rename them to reflect the `cba_genome_v1.0` notation after the fact; thus this step is not present in the SBATCH script.

Well, this is pretty exciting! Here's a quick assembly summary (found at the end of the [SLURM output file](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200917_cbai_flye_nanopore_genome_assembly/slurm-294008.out)):

```
INFO: Assembly statistics:

	Total length:	19216531
	Fragments:	3294
	Fragments N50:	14130
	Largest frg:	141601
	Scaffolds:	6
	Mean coverage:	17
```
Admittedly, there are definitely some issues with the assembly. For example, here's a portion of the FastA index file:

```
contig_3421	1	11083798	1	2
contig_2582	3	4548025	3	4
contig_3109	46	8747210	46	47
contig_2139	49	3182267	49	50
contig_4287	58	16100814	58	59
contig_3575	66	12248950	60	61
contig_793	69	18935471	60	61
contig_3976	84	14959281	60	61
contig_2281	104	3633003	60	61
contig_4015	104	15091851	60	61
```

Column #2 is the sequence length. The first two "contigs" have lengths of < 5bp! Obviously, this is useless. I know we can just filter out small contigs for subsequent analyses, but it's disconcerting that [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) actually spit these out as "contigs" instead of discarding them. I've [submitted an issue](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye/issues/304) to see if I can obtain some understanding about why this occurred.

Regardless, I'll get this posted to the [Genomic Resources wiki](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/wiki/Genomic-Resources).

So, where do we go from here? A couple of things:

- Visualize the assembly graphs with something like [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage). I'm hoping this will lead to a better understanding of how these graph assemblies (as opposed to alignment-based assemblies) work.

- Run BUSCO to assess genome "completeness".

- Attempt to separate out _Hematodinium_ sequences.

- Annotate the assembly with GenSAS and/or BLAST or something.

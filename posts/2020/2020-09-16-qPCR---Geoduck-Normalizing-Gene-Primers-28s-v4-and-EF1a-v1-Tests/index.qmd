On Monday (20200914), I [checked a set of 28s and EF1a primer sets](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/09/14/qPCR-Geoduck-Normalizing-Gene-Primer-Checks.html) and determined that 28s-v4 and EF1a-v1 were probably the best of the bunch, although they all looked great. So, I needed to test these out on some individual cDNA samples to see if they might be useful as normalizing genes - should have consistent Cq values across all samples/treatments.

Primers tested:

| SRID | Primer_Name |
|------|-------------|
| 1797 | 28s_v4_FWD  |
| 1796 | 28s_v4_REV  |
| 1795 | EF1a_v1_FWD |
| 1794 | EF1a_v1_REV |

I tested them on a set of _P.generosa_ hemolymph [cDNA made by Kaitlyn on 20200212](https://genefish.wordpress.com/2020/02/12/kaitlyns-notebook-testing-new-primers-on-geoduck-hemolymph-rna/).

I also used a 1:10 dilution of [geoduck gDNA (162ng/uL; from 20170105)](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2017/01/05/dna-isolation-geoduck-gdna-for-illumina-initiated-sequencing-project.html) as a positive control, as gDNA was amplified by all the primer sets on Monday.

All qPCR reactions were run in duplicate. See qPCR Report (Results section below) for plate layout, cycling params, etc.

28s-v4 melt plots aren't great and might even possibly have a slight shoulder, suggesting a secondary product. Not great. Additionally, the samples have a fairly large Cq range; not good for a normalizing gene.

EF1a-v1 melt plots look great, but the amplification also exhibits a Cq range that's too large for a normalizing gene.

With all of that said, I'm starting to think it would be best to re-quant the source RNA and remake cDNA.

Amplifcation and melt plots for each primer set are below. Color coding:

- RED: No Template Control (NTC)

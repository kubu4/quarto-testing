After reviewing the [Bionalyzer assays for the MBD BSseq libraries](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2020/2020-11-25-Bioanalyzer-M.magister-MBD-BSseq-Libraries.html) Mac indicated she'd like to have the libraries quantified using the Qubit./

I used 1uL of all samples with the 1x DNA HS Qubit Assay (Invitrogen) on the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0.

#### RESULTS

Qubit data (Google Sheet):

- [20201202_qubit_DNA_mmag_MBD-libraries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1og3084vUozB8cQEpja3nVl3G7_reLGVq5RlvaVCkNWw/edit?usp=sharing)

Will use this data, in conjunction with the Bioanalyzer average fragment size to determine molarity of each library, in preparation for sample pooling.

All data has been added to the principal Google Sheet for tracking this project:

- [OA Crab Sample Collection 071119](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ym0XnYVts98tIUCn0kIaU6VuvqxzV7LoSx9RHwLdiIs/edit#gid=1430155532)

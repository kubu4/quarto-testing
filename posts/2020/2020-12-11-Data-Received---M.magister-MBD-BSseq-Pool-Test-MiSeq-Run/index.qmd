[After creating _M.magister (C.magister; Dungeness crab) MBD-BSseq libraries (on 20201124)](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/11/24/MBD-BSseq-Library-Prep-M.magister-MBD-selected-DNA-Using-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Kit.html), I gave the pooled set of samples to [Mac for a test sequencing run on the MiSeq on 20201202](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/12/02/Sample-Submission-M.magister-MBD-BSseq-Libraries-for-MiSeq-at-NOAA.html).

MiSeq data consisted of 76bp paired-end (PE) sequencing.

All files were downloaded to the [`C_magister` folder on Owl](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/C_magister/)(Synology server).


Have added files to our high-throughput sequencing database (Google Sheet):

[Shelly asked me to run some qPCRs](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/982) (GitHub Issue), after some of the qPCR results I got from primer tests with [normalzing genes](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2020/2020-07-29-qPCR-Testing-P.generosa-Reproduction-related-Primers.html) and [potential gene targets](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/07/23/qPCR-Testing-P.generosa-Reproduction-related-Primers.html)./


Primers used:

| SRID | Primer_Name |
|------|-------------|
| 1769 | APLP_FWD    |
| 1768 | APLP_REV    |
| 1773 | TIF3s8_FWD-1 |
| 1772 | TIF3s8_REV-1 |

- TIF3s8 is expected to be used as a normalizing gene.


The cDNA being used will be samples [made by Kaitlyn on 20200212](https://genefish.wordpress.com/2020/02/12/kaitlyns-notebook-testing-new-primers-on-geoduck-hemolymph-rna/). Samples used are those lined up towards the top of the sample box. It's unclear to me why there are some samples in 0.5mL tubes and others in 1.7mL tubes:

Positive control was pooled cDNA, created by combining 2uL from each of the following:

All qPCR reactions were run in duplicate. See qPCR Report (Results section below) for plate layout, cycling params, etc.

Overall, the data itself looks fine. There are a few samples here and there where the replicates aren't great; primarily those that amplify very late (>37 Cq). This isn't terribly unusual, but as a mild perfectionist, it annoys me.

However, upon some brief analysis, it's clear that using `TIF3s8-1` as a normalizing gene will _not_ work. It fails to amplify in the majority of samples. Cross-checking with the results of `APLP` amplification in those same samples shows that `APLP` _did_ amplify in most of those same samples; thus ruling out an issue with the samples themselves.

Will let Shelly know and will probably come up with a plan for identifying new normalizing gene targets.

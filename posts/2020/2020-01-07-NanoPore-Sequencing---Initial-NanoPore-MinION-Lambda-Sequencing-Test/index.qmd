We recently acquired a NanoPore MinION sequencer, FLO-MIN106 flow cell and the Rapid Sequencing Kit (SQK-RAD004). The [NanoPore website](https://community.nanoporetech.com/guides/minion/rapid/introduction) provides a pretty thorough an user-friendly walk-through of how to begin using the system for the first time. With that said, I believe the user needs to have a registered account with NanoPore _and_ needs to have purchased some products to have full access to the protocols they provide.

For first time users, they provide a "Lambda Control experiment" which:

- teaches you how to use the sequencer, flow cells, and sequencing Kit

- sequences a known, small genome to allow fast sequencing and analysis

- free access to their `EPI2ME` analysis platform (which will perform basecalling, quality analysis, alignment, and generate a visually pleasing sequencing summary/report)

Honestly, it's a really helpful and easy way to get introduced to using the entire system. It's also not a bad way to sell the `EPI2ME` service, as it's very hands-off and easy to run.

Anyway, I set up the Lambda Control experiment sequencing run and ran it for the recommended duration (6hrs) with basecalling enabled (this will help speed up the subsequent `EPI2ME` service after sequencing is complete).

Overall, the run went as expected and yielded >8,000x coverage of the Lambda genome, with only ~2.8% of reads failing to map to the genome. Will proceed to running an actual sample!

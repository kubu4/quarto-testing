Submitted 1.5ug of the [24 _C.gigas_ ctenidia ctenidia gDNA isolated last week](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/08/21/DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification-C.gigas-High-Low-pH-Triploid-and-Diploid-Ctenidia.html) (20200821) to ZymoResearch for whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to compare differences in diploid/triploids and responses to elevated pH:

- 150bp PE reads

- ~60M reads/sample

NOTE: Those samples listed as 100.0uL used the entirety of the sample and did not have a full 1.5ug. However, ZymoResearch only needs 1.0ug; sending 1.5ug just ensures they have a bit extra if needed.

Isolated additional geoduck gDNA from the two fresh (now frozen) geoduck's that Brent provided me with on 20140212 so that we can potentially isolate RNA from the same geoducks to tie in with the DNA Illumina sequencing that Axa will be conducting. Isolated DNA using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (incubated minced siphon tissue at 56C for 3hrs). Eluted with 75uL of ddH2O and spec'd on NanoDrop1000.

Note: Initial specs were too low for Axa's requirements (50uL, >= 500ng/uL). SpeedVac'd samples to concentrate, brought volume to 55uL and then spec'd on NanoDrop1000.

Samples look good. Will send Axa 50uL of all samples, excluding GD01 since that sample is below his desired concentration AND I believe he probably doesn't want to wait for this DNA any longer.

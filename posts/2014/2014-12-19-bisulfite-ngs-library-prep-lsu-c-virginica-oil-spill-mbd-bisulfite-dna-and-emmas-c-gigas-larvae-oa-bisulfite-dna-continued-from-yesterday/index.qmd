Continued library prep from yesterday. Set up Library Amplification according to the protocol. The samples received the following Barcode Indices:



	
  * HB2 - 1 (ATCACG)

	
  * HB5 - 2 (CGATGT)

	
  * HB16 - 3 (TTAGGC)

	
  * HB30 - 4 (TGACCA)

	
  * NB3 - 5 (ACAGTG)

	
  * NB6 - 6 (GCCAAT)

	
  * NB11 - 7 (CAGATC)

	
  * NB21 - 12 (CTTGTA)

	
  * 1A1 - 2 (CGATGT)

	
  * 1A2 - 1 (ATCACG)

	
  * 6A1 - 4 (TGACCA)

	
  * 6A2 - 5 (ACAGTG)

	
  * 103B1 - 6 (GCCAAT)

	
  * 103B2 - 7 (CAGATC)

	
  * 105A4 - 12 (CTTGTA)

	
  * 105A5 - 11 (GGCTAC)


Due to differences in input DNA quantities, samples were run with different numbers of thermal cycles.

13 thermal cycles were run for the following samples:

	
  * 1A1

	
  * 105A4

	
  * 105A5


22 thermal cycles were run for the following samples:

	
  * HB2

	
  * HB5

	
  * HB16

	
  * HB30

	
  * NB3

	
  * NB6

	
  * NB11

	
  * NB21

	
  * 1A2

	
  * 6A1

	
  * 6A2

	
  * 103B1

	
  * 103B2


Samples were quantified with 1uL of each sample using the Quant-iT dsDNA BR Kit (Invitrogen). Used 5uL of each standard and standards were run in duplicate.

Quantified the library using the Quant-It BR Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Only used 1uL of the RAD library due to the small volume (15uL).

RAD library concentration (ng/uL): 18.688

Need to submit 5nM of the library for sequencing.

Average size = ~500bp (400bp extracted from gel + 100bp of adapters)

Molar concentration of the RAD library is 56.63nM.

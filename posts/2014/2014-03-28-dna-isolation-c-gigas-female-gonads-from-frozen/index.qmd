Isolated gDNA from Claire's "Female DNA" (from 05/16/2013) using the Qiagen Blood & Tissue DNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the following changes:





  1. Incubated sample in Buffer ATL + Proteinase K @ 56C for 3hrs. Vortexed once each hour.



  2. Eluted with 100uL of Buffer AE.

Excellent yield and quality is good, although both the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios are on the high side. However, these high values could be an artifact of the high sample concentration (this is a common "issue" with the NanoDrop).

- Added 500uL of DNAzol to each tube, transferred to 1.5mL tube and homogenized with disposable pestles

- Added additional 500uL DNAzol to each homogenized sample and mixed by inversion.

- Incubated 10mins at RT

- Pelleted debris by spinning 10,000g, 10mins, @ RT

- Transferred supes to new tubes

- Added 500uL of 100% EtOH to each; mixed by inversion; incubated 10mins @ RT

- Pelleted DNA by spinning 5,000g, 4mins, @ RT

- Discarded supes

- Washed DNA with 1mL 70% DNAzol/30% EtOH solution

- Spun 1000g, 1min, @ RT

- Discard supes

- Washed DNA with 1mL 75% EtOH

- Spun 1000g, 1min, @ RT

- Discarded supes

- Spun 1000g, 1min, @ RT

- Removed residual EtOH with pipette; air dried samples for 5mins @ RT

- Added 20uL of Trish-HCl (pH = 8.0) to each sample; incubated 10mins @ RT; flicked tubes to help dissolve

- Spun 12,000g, 10mins, @ RT

- Transferred supes to new tubes

- Spec'd on NanoDrop 1000 (ThermoFisher) and recovered solution from each sample due to limited sample volume

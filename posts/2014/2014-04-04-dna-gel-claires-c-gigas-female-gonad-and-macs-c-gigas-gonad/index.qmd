Ran out 2uL of Clair'es C.gigas female gonad gDNA (from 20140328) and Mac's C.gigas gonad gDNA (from 20140402) for quality assessment. Both samples had been isolated using Qiagen's Blood & Tissue DNeasy Kit. 2uL of each sample was run on a 0.8% 1x TBE gel.

Both samples show an extremely high amount of smearing. Additionally, both samples have definitive bands that correspond to ~1300bp and ~850bp.

After completing two rounds of MBD enrichment ([first 12 samples on 20190307](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/07/MBD-Enrichment-C.virginica-Sheared-Mantle-DNA-from-20190306.html) and the [second 12 samples on 20190311](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/11/MBD-Enrichment-C.virginica-Sheared-Mantle-DNA-from-20190306.html)), I performed ethanol precipitation, per the MethylMiner instructions with the following modifications:


- after additions of glycogen, sodium acetate and ethanol, incubated samples O/N at -80<sup>o</sup>C

- after incubation, the two elutions were consolidated in the following fashion:
  - the first of each of the two elutions was pelleted, supe discarded, and second elution transferred to the pellet
  - second elution was pelleted in same tube as first

- spins were performed at 13,000g

Samples were resuspended in 25uL of PCR H<sub>2</sub>O.

Currently, don't have appropriate tubes for quantification, so will do so once they arrive.

Samples were stored in the small -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer in the following box (Google Sheet):

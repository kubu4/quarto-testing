Steven wanted me to create a CpG GFF for use in IGV visulations for continued Pgenerosa_v074 analysis. I did that by running the EMBOSS tool `fuzznuc`:

```shell
~/programs/EMBOSS-6.6.0/emboss/fuzznuc \
-sequence ~/data/P_generosa/genomes/Pgenerosa_v074.fa \
-pattern CG \
-outfile 20190821_fuzznuc_pgenv074.gff \
-rformat gff
```

This was run on my computer, `swoose`.

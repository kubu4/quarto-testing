[Shelly asked me to isolate RNA](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/763) and run some qPCRs on the following samples:

I was unable to find the 11/01 and the 11/15 samples.

RNA was isolated using the Quick-DNA/RNA Microprep Plus Kit (ZymoResearch) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the following notes/changes:

- Added four volumes of lysis buffer for the hemolymph samples

- Performed on-column DNase step

- Elution volume = 15uL

After processing, samples were quantified using the Qubit hsRNA Assay, using 2uL of sample. Due to high sample concentrations (i.e. >100ng/uL) I had to dilute the samples a couple of times and re-measure.

#### RESULTS

Here are the three sets of raw data (Google Sheets):

Here's the summary table of sample concentrations:

| Sample ID | Original sample conc. (ng/uL) | Sample Vol (uL) | Yield (ng) |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| 31 H      | 25                            | 1000            | 25000      |
| 39H       | 79                            | 100             | 7900       |
| 57H       | 20                            | 100             | 2000       |
| 61H       | 47.7                          | 100             | 4770       |
| 11-08 1H  | 30.9                          | 15              | 463.5      |
| 11-08 2H  | 12.3                          | 100             | 1230       |


Will do some calculations and performs reverse transcription on these tomorrow, followed by qPCR with vitellogenin primers.

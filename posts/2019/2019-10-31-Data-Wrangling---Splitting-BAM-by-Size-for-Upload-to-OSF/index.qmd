We're in the process of organizing files for a manuscript dealing with the geoduck genome assembly/annotation we've done. As part of that, we need the [Stringtie BAM file that was used with GenSAS for Pgenerosa_v074 annotation](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/07/23/Genome-Annotation-Pgenerosa_v074-Transcript-Isoform-ID-with-Stringtie-on-Mox.html) to upload to the [Open Science Foundation repository for this project](https://osf.io/yem8n/). Unfortunately, at 73GB, the file far exceeds the individual file size limit for OSF (5GB). So, I split it into 5GB chunks. See the following notebook for deets:

Jupyter Notebook (GitHub):

 TL;DR:

 1. Use Bash command `split` to split the file into desired chunk sizes

 2. Reassemble chunks into full size BAM using the Bash `cat` command.

 3. Run `md5sum` on original BAM and reassembled BAM to confirm the two files are the same.

#### RESULTS

Output folder:

- [20191031_pgen_v074_stringtie_BAM_splitting/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20191031_pgen_v074_stringtie_BAM_splitting/)


Will upload split files to [OSF repository](https://osf.io/yem8n/).

Although I'd previously generated some feature stats for this genome annotation (see [20191029](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/10/29/Genome-Feature-Counts-Panopea-generosa-vv0.74.a4.html)), we decided we wanted to get some additional info, similar to that of [Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39734/tables/1) in [M.Aranda et al 2016. Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39734).

I'd [previously created intron and intergenic features](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/10/30/Data-Wrangling-Create-Panopea-generosa-vv0.74.a4-Intron-and-Intergenic-BED-Files.html), but didn't do any sort of analysis on them. In order to try to mirror some of what is in the table linked above, we need some stats from the introns file.

So, I generated some relevant stats with the introns file, as well as some other basic stats. Check out the deets in the Jupyter Notebook linked below.

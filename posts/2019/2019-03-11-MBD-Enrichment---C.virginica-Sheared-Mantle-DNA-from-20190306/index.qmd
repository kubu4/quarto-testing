[Last week I performed MBD enrichment on 12 of the 24 Lotterhos _C.viriginica_ mantle DNA](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/07/MBD-Enrichment-C.virginica-Sheared-Mantle-DNA-from-20190306.html) on samples I had [sheared on 20190306](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/06/DNA-Shearing-and-Bioanalyzer-Lotterhos-C.virginica-Mantle-gDNA-from-2018114.html). I proceeded with MBD enrichment using the MethylMiner Kit (Invitrogen) on the 12 remaining samples of the 24. I followed the manufacturer's protocol for input DNA >1ug - 10ug with the following modifications:

- 2500ng of input DNA used

- discarded washes post-DNA-binding

- performed high-salt elution

The full sample list and calculations are here (Google Sheet):

Will proceed with ethanol precipitations of all 24 samples.

Steven posted an [issue on GitHub regarding splitting a FastA file into multiple sequences](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/717). Specifically, he wanted a single, large FastA sequence (~89Mbp) split into smaller FastAs for BLASTing.

I downloaded the FastA he provided (https://d.pr/f/UlzHLR) and split the sequence into 2000bp chunks using the `faSplit` program (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/):

```shell
faSplit \
size \
20190731_faSplit_PGA-scaffold1_splits_2000bp/ \
2000
```

#### RESULTS

Output folder:

- [20190731_faSplit_PGA-scaffold1_splits_2000bp/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20190731_faSplit_PGA-scaffold1_splits_2000bp/)

This produced 38,734 FastA files.

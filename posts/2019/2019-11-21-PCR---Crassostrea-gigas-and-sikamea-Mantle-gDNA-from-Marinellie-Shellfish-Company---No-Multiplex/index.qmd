### UPDATE 20191125

Since the results I obtained on my [final attempt to get this to work](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/11/21/PCR-Crassostrea-gigas-and-sikamea-Mantle-gDNA-from-Marinellie-Shellfish-Company-No-Multiplex.html) failed, I decided to double-check the primer sequences.

Well, I ordered/used the wrong sequences! The two general _Crassostrea spp._ primers ordered were the 28s primers listed in that paper, instead of the cytochrome oxidase primers! I've ordered the correct universal CO primers [which are actually listed in this paper: ([Folmer, O., M. Black, W. Hoeh, R. Lutz & R. Vrijenhoek. 1994. DNA
primers for amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase
subunit I from diverse metazoan invertebrate. Mol. Mar. Biol.
Biotechnol. 3:294â€“299.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15316743_DNA_primers_for_amplification_of_mitochondrial_Cytochrome_C_oxidase_subunit_I_from_diverse_metazoan_invertebrates)) and will re-run this.

I'm leaving the original post below for posterity.

Primers and cycling parameters were taken from this publication:

- [Haiyan Wang and Ximing Guo "Identification of Crassostrea ariakensis and Related Oysters by Multiplex Species-Specific PCR," Journal of Shellfish Research 27(3), 481-487, (1 May 2008).](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ximing_Guo/publication/259643859_Identification_of_Crassostrea_ariakensis_and_related_oysters_by_multiplex_species-specific_PCR/links/55c79eb708aeb9756746e35e/Identification-of-Crassostrea-ariakensis-and-related-oysters-by-multiplex-species-specific-PCR.pdf)

| SR ID | Primer Name | Sequence                   |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 1727  | COreverse   | CAGGGGGCCGTTCGCGGTCAACGCT  |
| 1726  | COCsi546r   | AAGTAACCTTAATAGATCAGGGAACC |
| 1725  | COCgi269r   | TCGAGGAAATTGCATGTCTGCTACAA |
| 1724  | COforward   | GGGACTACCCCCTGAATTTAAGCAT  |

Instead of running a multiplex PCR as before, I ran each set of species-specific primer pairs independently.

The COforward/reverse primers should amplify any _Crassostrea spp._ DNA (i.e. a positive control - 697bp) and the other two primers will amplify either _C.gigas_ (Cgi269r - 269bp) or _C.sikamea_ (Csi546r - 546bp).

Well, it looks like the two species-specific reverse primers don't seem to work with the _Crassostrea spp._ forward primer.

However, the _Crassostrea spp._, despite the fact that they function properly (in that they amplify in all _Crassostrea_ DNA), they don't produce the expected band size that's mentioned in the paper (697bp). Talking with Steven, I don't think we're going to pursue much more of this.

Sent Roberto's 12 designated DNA samples for whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to Genewiz. They will do all bisulfite conversion, library prep and sequencing (Illumina HiSeq; 2x150bp; 30x coverage).

Also sent two samples prepared by Shelly (_Panopea generosa_) and two samples prepared by Yaamini.

Here's the list of samples:

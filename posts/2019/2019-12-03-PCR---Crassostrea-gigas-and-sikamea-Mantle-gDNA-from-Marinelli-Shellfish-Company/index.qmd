I ran this PCR a couple of times before and, embarrassingly, [I had ordered/used the wrong primers](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/11/21/PCR-Crassostrea-gigas-and-sikamea-Mantle-gDNA-from-Marinellie-Shellfish-Company-No-Multiplex.html).

Well, I ordered the correct universal cytochrome oxidase primers and used those!

| SR ID | Primer Name | Sequence                   |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 1739  | HC02198     | taaacttcagggtgaccaaaaaatca |
| 1738  | LCO1490     | ggtcaacaaatcataaagatattgg  |
| 1736  | COCsi546r   | AAGTAACCTTAATAGATCAGGGAACC |
| 1735  | COCgi269r   | TCGAGGAAATTGCATGTCTGCTACAA |


Primers and cycling parameters were taken from this publication:

- [Haiyan Wang and Ximing Guo "Identification of Crassostrea ariakensis and Related Oysters by Multiplex Species-Specific PCR," Journal of Shellfish Research 27(3), 481-487, (1 May 2008).](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ximing_Guo/publication/259643859_Identification_of_Crassostrea_ariakensis_and_related_oysters_by_multiplex_species-specific_PCR/links/55c79eb708aeb9756746e35e/Identification-of-Crassostrea-ariakensis-and-related-oysters-by-multiplex-species-specific-PCR.pdf)

Universal cytochrome oxidase primers were from this paper:

- [Folmer, O., M. Black, W. Hoeh, R. Lutz & R. Vrijenhoek. 1994. DNA
primers for amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase
subunit I from diverse metazoan invertebrate. Mol. Mar. Biol.

This is a multiplex PCR, where the HC02198 and LCO1490 primers should amplify any _Crassostrea spp._ DNA (i.e. a positive control - 697bp) and the other two primers will amplify either _C.gigas_ (Cgi269r - 269bp) or _C.sikamea_ (Csi546r - 546bp).

Alrighty, this is what we expected to see (at least in terms of primer functionality). We see:

- A band of ~700bp in all samples (i.e. the universal cytochrome oxidase primers)

- A band of ~270bp in the`C.gigas 1911SS` samples


Now, this is where things get interesting...

In the `C.sikamea CA5SS`:

- A prominent band of ~550bp, indicating these are _C.sikamea_

- A less prominent, but definitive, band at ~270bp, indicating the presence of _C.gigas_ cytochrome oxidase sequence. Suggests that this particular stock has hybridized with _C.gigas_ (or, there was some sort of cross contamination of DNA/tissue; unlikely as we _don't_ see potential cross contamination of _C.sikamea_ DNA in the other samples).

In the `C.sikamea 1911SS`:

- A prominent band of ~270bp, indicating these are _C.gigas_, despite the bag label indicating them as Kumamoto _and/or_ Pacific oysters (see image below)

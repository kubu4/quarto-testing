_Crassostrea virginica_ samples that were subjected to MBD enrichment (completed [20190319](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/19/MBD-Enrichment-DNA-Quantification-of-C.virginica-MBD-Samples-from-20190312.html)) were shipped, on dry ice, to ZymoResearch today for BSseq. They will perform bisulfite conversion, library prep, and sequencing. Sequencing output is to be ~50M paired-end reads (at least 100bp or 151bp) per library.

Steven was recently contacted by Marinelli Shellfish Company to see if we could help them determine if some oysters they had were _Crassostrea gigas_ (Pacific oyster) or _Crassostrea sikamea_ (Kumamoto). Steven knows of a paper with primer sequences to use with qPCR for this specific determination.

They sent ~12 of:

- known _Crassostrea gigas_

- known _Crassostrea sikamea_

- unknown

We collected mantle tissue from 12 of each group. Samples were labeled in the following fashion:

- _C.gigas_ 1191-SS ## (known _Crassostrea gigas_)

- _C.sikamea_ CA5SS ## (known _Crassostrea sikamea_)

- _C.sikamea_ 1191-SS ## (unknown)


 Samples were stored at -80<sup>o</sup>C in Rack 2, Column 4, Row 5:

- [-80<sup>o</sup>C Inventory](http://b.link/srlab-80C)

NOTE: Only 11 samples were collected for _C.sikamea_ CA5SS.

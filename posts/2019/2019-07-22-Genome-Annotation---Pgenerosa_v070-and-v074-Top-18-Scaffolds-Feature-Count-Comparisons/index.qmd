After [annotating Pgenerosa_v074 on 20190701](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/07/01/Genome-Annotation-Pgenerosa_v074-MAKER-on-Mox.html), we noticed a large discrepancy in the number of transcripts that MAKER identified, compared to Pgenerosa_v070. As a reminder, the Pgenerosa_v074 is a subset of Pgenerosa_v070 containing only the top 18 longest scaffolds. So, we decided to do a quick comparison of the annotations present in these 18 scaffolds Pgenerosa_v070 and Pgenerosa_v074.

Briefly, used `grep` to pull out features identified in the same 18 scaffolds in the Pgenerosa_v074 assembly from [Pgenerosa_v070 annotated GFF from 20190228](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/02/28/Genome-Annotation-Pgenerosa_v070-MAKER-on-Mox.html) and then counted the number of features identified in this newly subsetted GFF. It's all documented in the Jupyter Notebook below.

Well, we definitely see a difference between annotations of those top 18 scaffolds (~6-fold difference). However, there is still a _huge_ difference between the full Pgenerosa_v070 annotation and the top 18 scaffolds from the Pgenerosa_v070 annotation.

I'll be performing some RNAseq alignments to these various assemblies. That should provide us with some evidence that we can use to support/refute some of the annotations that are present/absent.

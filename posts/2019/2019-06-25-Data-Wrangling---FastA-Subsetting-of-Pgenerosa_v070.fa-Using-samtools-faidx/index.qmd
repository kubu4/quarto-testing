Steven asked to subset the [Pgenerosa_v070.fa](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/halfshell/genomic-databank/Pgenerosa_v070.fa) (2.1GB) in this [GitHub Issue #705](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/705). In that issue, it was determined that a significant portion of the sequencing data that was assembled by Phase Genomics clustered in "scaffolds" 1 - 18. As such, Steven asked to subset just those 18 scaffolds.

This was done by using the `samtools faidx` program.

Process is documented in the following Jupyter Notebook (GitHub):

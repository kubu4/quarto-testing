We received frozen _Crassostrea gigas_ tissues from Maria Haws in Hawaii, as part of a pCO<sub>2</sub> experiment. Tissues include:

- adductor muscle (A)

- gill (G)

- gonad (N)

- mantle (M)

Tubes were boxed and stored in the -80<sup>o</sup>C:

The low pH samples had two casualties:

- Sample '1LA' has no tube; just a lid

- Sample '3LN' lid popped up in transit and tissue is missing

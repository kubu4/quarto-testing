In preparation for some manuscripts, Steven asked that I get some geoduck RNAseq data upload to the [NCBI sequencing read archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) in [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/630). Specifically, he needed the data corresponding to day 5 (pos-fertilization) larve RNAseq data that was prepped/run by Illumina on the NovaSeq. Original sample submission notebook entry is [here](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2016/12/21/sample-submission-geoduck-tissue-gdna-for-illumina-pilot-sequencing-project.html).

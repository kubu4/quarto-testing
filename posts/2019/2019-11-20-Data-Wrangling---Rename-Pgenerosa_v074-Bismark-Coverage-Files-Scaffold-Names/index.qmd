After a meeting today, Steven and Hollie realized that the Bismark coverage files were still using the old scaffold names, stemming from the Pgenerosa_v074 naming. I'd [previously updated filenames and scaffold names](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/11/05/Data-Wrangling-Rename-Pgenerosa_v074-Files-and-Scaffolds.html), so I recycled some of the code used there to rename the coverage files.

The renaming was done in the following Jupyter Notebook (GitHub):

- [20191120_swoose_pgen_v074_renaming.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/code/blob/master/notebooks/sam/20191120_swoose_pgen_v074_renaming.ipynb)

#### RESULTS

Output folder:

- [20191120_swoose_pgen_v074_renaming/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20191120_swoose_pgen_v074_renaming)

All files have also been uploaded to the `bismark_coverage_files` folder in the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/yem8n/) for this project.

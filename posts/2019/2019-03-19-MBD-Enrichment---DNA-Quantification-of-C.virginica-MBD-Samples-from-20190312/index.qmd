[Finished MBD enrichment on 20190312](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/12/MBD-Enrichment-Ethanol-Precipitation-of-C.virginica-MBD-samples.html) using the MethylMiner kit. Since we were out of Qubit assay tubes, I could not quantify these samples when I initially completed the ethanol precipitation. Tubes are in, so I went forward with quantification using the Roberts' Lab Qubit 3.0 and the 1x High Sensitivity dsDNA assay.

Used 1uL of each sample.

#### RESULTS

Qubit data (Google Sheet):

- [20190319_qubit_DNA_Cvir_MBD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhd_wyxJn234Lw8Wk9F6dUfjIWdVHfck_ON7tAi2FXo/edit?usp=sharing)

Concentrations range from 0.702ng/uL to 3.44ng/uL. This corresponds to a recovery rate range of 0.7% - 3.44% (17.6ng - 86ng). Although that low sample is pretty low, I'm fairly certain ZymoResearch can handle sample input this low without issue. Will get a PO number generated and get these sent off to Zymo for bisulfite conversion, library prep and sequencing.

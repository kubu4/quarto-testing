Yesterday, I [sheared the Lotterhos C.virginica gDNA in preparation for MBD enrichment](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/06/DNA-Shearing-and-Bioanalyzer-Lotterhos-C.virginica-Mantle-gDNA-from-2018114.html). Today, I proceeded with MBD enrichment using the MethylMiner Kit (Invitrogen) on 12 of the 24 samples. I followed the manufacturer's protocol for input DNA >1ug - 10ug with the following modifications:

- 2500ng of input DNA used

- discarded washes post-DNA-binding

- performed high-salt elution

- elutions were stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C until ready for EtOH precipitation next week

The full sample list and calculations are here (Google Sheet):

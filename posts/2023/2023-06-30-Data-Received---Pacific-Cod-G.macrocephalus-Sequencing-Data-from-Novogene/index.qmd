Downloaded Pacific cod (_G.macrocephalus) sequencing data. I believe this is a NOAA project, and I don't have any info about it. So, not much to report here.

Checksums were confirmed after transfer. Due to the large number of files I couldn't screencap the `md5sum` output in a single image, so there are three images below.

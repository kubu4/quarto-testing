Quantified RNA [earlier today]() and proceeded to make cDNA. Reverse transcription was performed using oligo dT primers using M-MLV RT (Promega), per the manufacturer's recommendations. Used 400ng of RNA in each reaction. I used 400ng (instead of the usual 100ng) to simplify pipetting for high concentration samples, without the need/time to dilute samples. All reactions were done on ice in 0.5uL PCR tubes.

cDNA was stored in the same -80<sup>o</sup>C box as the original RNA.

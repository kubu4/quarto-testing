Steven [asked me to generate cDNA](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1675) (GitHub Issue) from [_Crassostrea gigas_ (Pacific oyster)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster) RNA, as part of Matt George's polyIC project. Before starting reverse transcription, I felt it would be best to quantify the RNA using the Qubit 3.0 using the Broad Range Assay. Steven and I discussed which samples to use earlier this week.

Used 1uL of each sample.

See Results section below for sample/tube labels.

#### RESULTS


- [20230721-qubit-cgig-polyIC-RNA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16No1oXbb9foftO--AYqzoJY2jbyLrqUS8AZpjYkU7KU/edit#gid=1874673482) (Google Sheet)

All samples had ample amount of RNA. Will proceed with reverse transcription.

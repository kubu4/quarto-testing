After [isolating ctenidia RNA on 20230712](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2023/2023-07-12-RNA-Isolation-C.gigas-Ctenidia-from-Noah's-Heat-Mechanical-Stress-Project.html) and then quantifying the RNA [earlier today](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2023/07/13/RNA-Quantification-C.gigas-RNA-from-Noah's-Heat-Mechanical-Stress-Project.html), I needed to perform reverse transcription to have cDNA for subsequent qPCRs. Reverse transcription was performed using oligo dT primers using M-MLV RT (Promega), per the manufacturer's recommendations. Used 100ng of RNA in each reaction. All reactions were done on ice in 0.5uL PCR tubes./

In preparation for qPCR and primer testing, 2uL from each sample was pooled together in a separate 0.5uL tube. All cDNA was stored in Noah's -80<sup>o</sup>C project box.

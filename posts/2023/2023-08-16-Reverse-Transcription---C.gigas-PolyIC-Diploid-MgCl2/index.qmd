After [quantifying diploid MgCl<sub>2</sub>](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2023/08/16/RNA-Quantification-C.gigas-PolyIC-Diploid-MgCl2.html) (Notebook) earlier today and proceeded to make cDNA. Reverse transcription was performed using oligo dT primers using M-MLV RT (Promega), per the manufacturer's recommendations. Used 400ng of RNA in each reaction. I used 400ng (instead of the usual 100ng) to simplify pipetting for high concentration samples, without the need/time to dilute samples. All reactions were done on ice in 0.5uL PCR tubes.

cDNA was stored in the same -80<sup>o</sup>C box as the original RNA.

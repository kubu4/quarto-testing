Repeat across gel.\nMembrane was cut into four pieces: two for standard Western blotting and two for the colorimetric development. These were blocked in 15mL of blocking solution (standard) or 10mL of blocking solution (chromogenic) for 30mins. Primary antibodies used were anti-c-Myc (mouse) and anti-His (rabbit). For the standard Western, they were used at a 1:5000 dilution. For the colorimetric, they were used at a 1:1000 dilution (per the antibody info sheet). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hr. Membranes were washed per the protocol. Secondary antibodies (GAR AP for chromogenic; DAR HRP & GAM HRP for chemiluminescent) were added. 1:3000 dilution for chromogenic and 1:5000 dilution for chemiluminescent. Incubated for 30 mins. Membranes were washed per the protocol.\nChromogenic: Added substrate to membranes and incubated for ~5mins. until band was very prominent.\n\nResults:\nProminent band is MSTN1b. Smearing is commonly seen with this recombinant protein. Positive control lysate (12-tag marker) was not detected.\nChemiluminescent: Added 4mL total of Millipore Immobilon chemiluminescent reagent to both membranes. 10 min. expsoure.\n\nResults:\nMembrane on the left only shows detection of MSTN1b and not the positive control lysate. The membrane on the right shows both MSTN and the positive control lysate."

Lane 2 (bay gDNA/bay actin primer) has a large, ~1000bp band and lane 7 (sea gDNA/sea actin primer) produces a ~300bp band. Unfortunately, this does provide us with any useful info. Something needs to be reworked (i.e. possibly new target gene) in order to start getting some useful results.\nHowever, the results we did get definitely confirm that the hybrids are NEITHER hybrids nor bay scallop, due to the fact that no bands are present in any other sample than the bay scallop gDNA samples."

The others that have no remaining RNA are a surprise and is a bit disconcerting.\nWill take fresh RNA aliquots of those samples for DNasing.

Turns out the tubes being used were not resistant to chloroform. This was realized after spinning at 18,000RPM, 25C 10mins in a Sorval SL-50T rotor in the Sorval T21 centrifuge.\nHowever…\nI recovered the aqueous phase anyway, as it was still contained in the tube and had no contact with the rotor surface(s). Due to a subsequent phenol:chloroform:IAA step, I split the aqueous phase into 24 x 1.5mL snap cap tubes and proceeded according to protocol. The final DNA pellet, prior to resuspension were combined from all the tubes into a single 1.5mL snap cap tube in a final volume of 400uL of TE.\n\nResults: DNA from today looks good with excellent yield. DNA from 20090513 doesn’t look as nice AND the concentration doesn’t jive with the QC gel that was run on 20090513. Will run out on gel according to JGI protocol to evaluate quality further."

Since we’re just looking for positive/negative samples, I ran this on the Opticon 2 despite the recent “problems” we’ve been having with it. Cycling params used with the 2x HRM M.M. are as follows:\n95C - 10mins\n40 cycles of:\n95C - 10s\n60C - 15s\n72C - 25s\nResults: Overall, looks good. Negative control is clean. Based on signal strength and clean, tight melting curves, the following primer sets (location in CMA01 primer/qPCR plates) will be used for HRM analysis tomorrow: C11, D3, E12, D3. Actually, never mind. Steven’s sent me contig info for the lake trout so we’ll just order and test primers that are more likely to produce good data instead of worrying about the salmonid primers."

The real-time PCR was run in a Roche LightCycler480 machine with the following cycling paramters:\n95C - 15mins\n45 cycles of:\n95C - 10s\n60C - 15s\n72C - 25s\nAfter the completion of the real-time run, the plate was put through the High Melt Curve protocol.\nResults:"

However, yields seem pretty good…\nTotal, mRNA and fragmented mRNA from each of the four samples was run on the Pico chip with the Eukaryote Total RNA Bioanalyzer protocol.\nResults:\n\nThe 2L tot (total RNA) and 3L tot (total RNA) samples are clearly very good quality. 2L tot does exhibit some very slight degradation, though. 4L tot (total RNA) and 6L tot (total RNA) show a much greater degree of degradation. All mRNA samples show complete removal of any trace, contaminating rRNA. The fragmented samples (the last four samples on the gel image above) all appear to be perfect. The 4L frag sample simply has less RNA loaded and that is why it is not as dark as the other three fragmented samples. Despite the degradation in the 4L tot and 6L tot samples, the fragmentation profile looks good and we will proceed with making the cDNA libraries for those samples."

Can repeat PCR for 6L using outer gel slices and reduce the number of cycles to prevent overamplification, if desired. Spoke to Steven and since these samples won’t be used to evaluate gene expression (they’re for SNP discovery), we won’t worry about it for the time being.\nSample 4L has some very strange signals being generated in the ~500-800bp range.

    "text": "Received new FAM calibration reagent. It comes pre-prepared in a 1x PCR buffer (0.3uM), however there is only enough for a single plate (use 50uL/well). Will run plate in Opticon 2. Run according to the calibration protocol in the Opticon 2 manual (p. 10-4).\nResults:\n\nWell, there’s actually a signal this time as opposed to the run on 20090806. However, it’s pretty clear that the signals aren’t even close to being uniform. Or, as the manual says “tightly clustered lines”. I’m also not sure why the fluorescence decreases over time, although it could simply be degradation of the fluorophore after being hit with light. I’ve sent the results to Bio-Rad for help interpreting them."

Since samples were stored in pH-adjusted NaOH (see 20100605), they needed to be precipitated in order to have the gDNA suspended in TE for the downstream steps of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). 10% 3M sodium acetate (pH = 5.2) was added to each tube, then 2.5 vols of 100% EtOH and mixed.

Gel was run on 20100607.\n\nThe results are pretty interesting.\nMost of the R51 samples are pretty good looking (i.e. high molecular weight band, little smearing), but there are some samples that show a high degree of degradation (e.g. #18, #19).\nAll of the R37 samples look STELLAR (i.e. high molecular weight band, no smearing)!\nThe stark differences between the R51 samples and the R37 are intriguing. Although not currently verified (as of 20100607), I suspect that the amount of tissue stored in RNA Later possibly contributes to the long term integrity of the DNA, as nearly all of the R37 samples had very little tissue in the RNA Later. Whereas the R51 tissue samples were significantly larger in virtually every sample. I will do a visual inspection of the tubes to see if there is indeed a correlation between tissue size and apparent DNA quality."

Average = 96.3 beads/square\nCalculation of beads: Avg (beads/square) x Volume in hemocytometer (uL) x total # squares on hemocytometer (squares) x dilution factor = beads/uL\nTotal bead recovery: beads/uL x volume of beads (uL)\nSo, my recovery is: 96.3 beads/square x 10uL x 25 squares x 200 = 4.817x10^6 beads/uL\nTotal beads recovered: 4.817x10^6 beads/uL x 200uL = 9.63x10^8 beads.\nDesired # of beads is between 1-2 billion. I recovered 963 million. Close.\nFinal count of enriched, templated-beads: 8, 14, 16, 10. Average = 12\nMy final recovery is: 12 beads/square x 10uL x 25 sqaures x 10 = 30000 beads/uL.\nTotal enriched, templated beads recovered: 30000 beads/uL x 400uL = 12x10^6 beads.\nEnrichment efficiency percentage calculation: (# templated beads)/(Starting # beads) x 100\nMy enrichment efficiency percentage: 12x10^6 beads/9.63x10^8 beads x 100 = 1.2%\nBeads were stored @ 4C until more templated beads are generated.\nResults: The yield of beads is not entirely unexpected, according to Rhonda, because I started the procedure using only 0.5pM of the library. However, each section on an octet slide (which is what we plan on using) requires 46 million beads. Clearly this is short of that quantity. The procedure will be repeated with a greater amount of starting cDNA library. It should be noted that there is NOT a linear relationship between the amount of starting template and the amount of enriched, templated beads one ends up with in this protocol. So, even though I will be increasing the starting amount of template by 3-fold, a 3-fold increase in the amount of enriched, templated beads is NOT expected (hopefully it’ll be more than that!)."

Transferred supe to new tubes. Precipitated DNA with 0.25mL 100% EtOH. Incubated 3mins @ RT. DNA was pelleted 5mins @ 5000g @ RT. Supe was removed, pellets were washed with 1mL 75% EtOH (x2). Supe was fully removed and the DNAs were resuspended in 800uL 8mM NaOH (made by Amanda Davis 5/20/10).\n1M HEPES (provided with DNAzol) was added at a 1:100 dilution to achieve a pH = 8.0. This was based on the DNAzol protocol calculations (For 1mL of 8mM NaOH, use 101uL of 0.1M HEPES = pH 8.0).\nSamples were spec’d on NanoDrop 1000 on 20100607. Used a sample with 8mM NaOH and 1M HEPES to match the pH = 8.0 of the samples.\nResults:\n\nYields are very good and the 260/280 ratios are pretty good. The 260/230 ratios are very poor and is likely due to the large amount of larvae used in the procedure. Will run samples on a gel to evaluate DNA integrity. **_UDPATE: Mac ran these samples on 6/9/10 (see her notebook on that date) and they look perfect.**_"

It would be extremely interesting to see if the degradation has any effect on sequencing, as the mRNA will get fragmented any way in the next step of library construction.\nmRNA isolations worked for all samples. Although one might be inclined to say that mRNA isolation did NOT work for the WB sample, one has to take in to consideration that the gel software adjusts the gel contrast to enhance low signals. That’s why all the mRNA samples exhibit a dark background. mRNA generates a broad, relatively weak signal when compared to a total RNA sample. So, the software attempts to boost the low signal for display purposes. Thus, if we were to decrease this signal boosting (or contrast) for the WB mRNA so that the background color matched the WB total RNA background color (white), the rRNA bands visible in the WB mRNA sample would fade to a point where they would not be visible. See the electropherogram overlay (below the gel) for a more visual comparison of this concept.\n\n\nElectropherogram Overlays of WB total RNA and WB rRNA\n\nThe WB total RNA is the red graph which shows extremely high levels of rRNA (as expected). After subsequent mRNA isolation (the blue graph), the rRNA is virtually gone and no longer comprises a significant portion of the sample."

    "text": "Continued with gDNA isolation from yesterday’s samples. Additionally, isolated gDNA from R51 01, but homogenized the tissue (using disposable 1.5mL mortar/pestle) in 0.5mL of DNAzol and topped off to 1.0mL. All 3 samples were gently pipetted up and down to further dissolve the tissue. For those samples that were subjected to Proteinase K digestion, I transferred 100uL of the solution to a new tube containing 1mL of DNAzol, [as described in the DNAzol protocol (see “Notes, #5” part of protocol)(https://www.mrcgene.com/dnazol.htm). Tubes were incubated 10mins @ RT.\nPelleted residual tissue 10mins @ 10,000g @ 4C. Transferred supe to new tubes. Precipitated DNA with 0.5mL 100% EtOH. Incubated 3mins @ RT. DNA was pelleted 5mins @ 5000g @ 4C. Supe was removed, pellets were washed with 1mL 75% EtOH (x2). Supe was fully removed and the pellets were resuspended in 8mM NaOH (made by Amanda Davis 5/20/10). See below for volumes:\nR51 11 - 50uL\nR51 01 - 100uL\nR51 01 homogenized - 200uL\n1M HEPES (provided with DNAzol) was added at a 1:100 dilution to achieve a pH = 8.0. This was based on the DNAzol protocol calculations (For 1mL of 8mM NaOH, use 101uL of 0.1M HEPES).\nSamples were spec’d on NanoDrop 1000. Used a sample with 8mM NaOH and 1M HEPES to match the pH = 8.0 of the samples.\nResults:\n\nThe 260/280 ratios for all samples are great. Yields are significantly lower than I was expecting. However, for R51 11 and R51 01, only 100uL (1/5th) of the digestion was used as described in the protocol. I may recover the remainder of the R51 11 gDNA since remaining tissue could be a limiting factor. The homogenized sample had the highest yield (9.35ug), suggesting this may be a more efficient approach to obtaining gDNA (faster procedure and higher yields).\nThese results also demonstrate that gDNA can be successfully isolated from samples stored in RNA Later (gel pending).\nDue to low yields of the R51 11 and R51 01 samples, these will not be run on a gel until the rest of the DNA is isolated.\nIsolated the remainder of the gDNA from R51 11 and R51 01. Added an additional 0.5mL of DNAzol to each tube and pipetted up and down to further dissolve the remaining tissue. Then, proceeded as described above. Samples were resuspended in 200uL of 8mM NaOH with 2.02uL of 1M HEPES added.\nResults:\n\nBoth samples have great yields and excellent 260/280 ratios. Digestion, combined with gentle pipetting to disrupt undigested tissue, appears to lead to higher yields. However, the process is more time consuming than just basic, physical homogenization of tissue.\n\nGel Loading (0.5ug of each DNA was loaded in a volume of 25uL)\nLane 1. Hyperladder\nLane 2. R51 11\nLane 3. R51 01\nLane 4. R51 01 homogenized\nThe R51 11 sample looks perfect. The other two samples however, appear degraded, with the homogenized sample looking the worst. Interestingly, those are both from the same source tissue, possibly suggesting that the DNA in this particular gill sample is actually degraded and is independent of the preparation, since the R51 11 (Lane 2) and R51 01 (Lane 3) were prepared simultaneously and in the same way. The gel also seems to show that physically homogenizing the sample leads to greater degradation than performing the Proteinase K digestion."

Possibly explains why the 260/280 ratios for the MeDIP DNA are so high, too?\nThese results demonstrate what we can expect to recover from this procedure, as well as how much DNA gets lost during processing.

One mild concern, however, is the yield from the the Lean library. An 8-well slide requires 41 million beads for a run. Additionally, I believe 15 million are needed for a WFA (quality check, pre-run). This means that the Lean prep is nearly 10 million beads short of what is necessary for a “complete” run of this sample. Will send the numbers to Rhonda and see what her opinion is and what she suggests to do. But, based on the percent recovery, all the samples should be really high quality (extremely few polyclonal beads)."

The order within each MM group (from left to right) is: template, NTC, NTC.\nAll bands boxed with green were purified using Millipore’s Ultrafree-DA spin columns. Samples were stored @ -20C in “Sam’s Misc. -20C Box”.\nMM07 - Fails to produce any bands of any size. Suggests the presence of intron(s) causing the size of the potential amplicon to exceed the capabilities of the polymerase under these cycling conditions.\nMM08 - Produces a band of ~400bp which is well below the expected 1540bp (if no introns) size. Due to the faintness of the band, the band was not excised. Will consult with Steven to see if he thinks it worth repeating to produce sufficient product for sequencing.\nMM09 - Produce a ~500bp band. The band was excised. This band size is ~275bp larger than the expected size of 225bp. This implies the presence of an intron in this region. This band size differs from that produced by MM10, which suggests that this primer set can be used for qPCR AND distinguish between the COX1 and COX2 isoforms.\nMM10 - Produced a ~700bp band. The band was excised. This band size is ~475bp larger than the expected size of 225bp. This implies the presence of an intron in this region. This band size differs from that produced by MM09, which suggests that this primer set can be used for qPCR AND distinguish between the COX1 and COX2 isoforms.\nMM11 - Produced multiple bands, of which two were excised; a ~3000bp band and a ~600bp band. These bands were excised solely based on their intensity and their immediate useability for sequencing. Will discuss with Steven on whether or not this should be repeated and the other bands excised for sequencing purposes. Both bands that were excised exceed the expected band size of ~275bp, suggesting the presence of multiple introns. Additionally, the presence of so many products suggests that the primers are not very specific, in regards to their target.\nMM12 - An extremely faint band of ~350bp can be seen, however, due to it’s faintness and it’s small size (expected size was ~812bp), the band was not excised. Will discuss with Steven to see if this warrants repeating to accumulate sufficient product for sequencing purposes. No amplification of any larger products suggests the presence of introns, causing the size of the potential amplicon to exceed the capabilities of the polymerase under these cycling conditions. This is also confirmed by the MM11 PCR results in which a 3000bp band was produced. Since the primer set in MM12 has an additional 600bp at the 5’ end, this has already exceeded the abilities of the polymerase, even if this addtional 600bp does NOT include an additional intron. However, it is curious that the MM12 primer set does not produce smaller, spurious PCR products as is seen in the MM11 primer set (these two primer sets both use the same forward primer)."

    "title": "qPCR - Emma’s New 3KDSqPCR Primers",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Due to previous contamination issues with Emma’s primers, Emma asked me to order new primers, reconstitute them and run a qPCR for her to see if we could eliminate her contamination issues with this primer set. cDNA template was supplied by Emma (from 2/2/11) and was from a C.gigas 3hr Vibrio vulnificus challenge. Samples were run in duplicate, as requested. Master mix calcs are here. Plate layout, cycling params, etc. can be found in the qPCR Report (see Results). Primer set used was:\nCg_3KDSqPCR_F/R (SR IDs: 1186, 1187)\nResults:\nqPCR Data File (BioRad CFX96)\nqPCR Report (PDF)\nThe negative controls (NTC) are negative, meaning they do not cross the threshold set by the BioRad software. However, there is clearly amplification in the NTCs, but they come up late enough that they do not cross the threshold and, thus, generate a Cq value. Additionally, the melt curve reveals peaks in the NTCs that are at the same melting temperature as the product produced in the cDNA qPCR reactions. This would potentially imply some sort of contamination, as Emma has experienced.\nHonestly, I do no think contamination is the problem. I believe that the “contamination” being seen in the NTCs is actually primer dimer. Increasing the annealing temperature (I’m not sure if Emma tried this during her troubleshooting) could potentially alleviate this issue. However, I’m not sure she’s amplifying the target that she wants to. Based on my analysis, I think she needs to re-design primers for her 3KDS target. Read my analysis and why I came to this conclusion below.\nIt seems unlikely that two independent people (and multiple primer stock replacements!) would have contamination, so I looked in to things a bit further.\nI BLASTed the primer sets (NCBI, blastn, est_others db, C.gigas only) and the BLAST results reveal the primers matching with a C.gigas EST sequence that would produce a band of only 63bp. Here’s a screen capture of the BLAST results:\n\nThis result does NOT agree with what is entered in our Primer Database. As entered in our sheet, the expected PCR product would be ~102bp. However, taking in to account the BLAST results, it would be difficult to distinguish the difference between primer dimers and PCR product in a melt curve analysis.\nEmma has previously run a conventional PCR with these primers and ran a gel (see below). At the time, it was thought to be contamination, but in retrospect (knowing the results of the qPCRs and the BLAST results) it seems likely that what she’s seeing in the negative controls was actually primer dimer, which was the same size of her PCR product (which she thought should be larger). Additionally, the gel was difficult to interpret because no ladder was run. A ladder might have revealed that her PCR product was half the size that she was expecting:"

    "text": "Attempt to obtain full genomic sequence for C.gigas COX. PCR set up/cycling params/etc are here. Primer set combinations(master mixes) are as follows:\nMM01 - Cg_COX_5’UTR_3_F (SR ID: 1150) + Cg_COX_1009_R (SR ID: 1147) Band size w/o intron = ~1000bp\nMM02 - “” + Cg_COX_1545_R (SR ID: 1148) Band size w/o intron = ~1540bp\nMM03 - “” + Cg_COX_2138_R (SR ID: 1149) Band size w/o intron = ~2135bp\nMM04 - Cg_COX_982_F (SR ID: 1151) + Cg_COX_1545_R (SR ID: 1148) Band size w/o intron = ~550bp\nMM05 - “” + Cg_COX_2138_R (SR ID: 1149) Band size w/o intron = ~1130bp\nMM06 - Cg_COX_1519_F (SR ID: 1146) + Cg_COX_2138_R (SR ID: 1149) Band size w/o intron = ~620bp\nResults:\n\nBioline Hyperladder I used for marker. Gel is loaded with template samples at the far left of each master mix group with two no template controls (NTC) in the remaining two wells of each master mix group. All NTCs on the gel are clean.\nAll bands surrounded by a green box were excised from the gel.\nMM01, MM02 and MM03 - The smallest expected band (i.e. no intron present) would have been 1000bp in MM01. Instead, we see faint banding of multiple sizes less than 1000bp in both MM01 and MM02. MM03 fails to produce any bands. This potentially suggests a couple of things. Firstly, the multiple banding produced in MM01 and MM02 suggests that the PCR conditions lead to some non-specific priming and should be optimized. Secondly, the fact that no bands were produced that are equal to or larger than the “no intron size” suggests that intron(s) may exist in the 5’ region of the COX gene and are large enough that the polymerase had insufficient time/ability to amplify.\nMM04 - Three distinct bands were produced: 2000bp, 1500bp and 550bp. The size of band that would have been produced had an intron NOT been present would have been ~550bp. A band of this size was produced in this PCR reaction. However, two additional bands were produced. The presence of these two larger bands lends additional evidence for the existence of multiple isoforms of COX (which is also supported by the fact that multiple isoforms of COX are known to exist in most other species). The 2000bp band was excised and purified with Millipore Ultra-free DA spin columns and stored @ -20C until a sequencing plate is readied.\nMM05 - A distinct band of ~5000bp was produced. This is significantly larger than the “no intron size” of ~1130bp, suggesting the presence of an intron. This band was excised, but not purified due to the low concentration of DNA in the gel. The gel slice was stored @ -20C until this PCR reaction could be repeated to accumulate sufficient product for sequencing.\nMM06 - A distinct band of ~2200bp was produced. This is significantly larger than the “no intron size” of ~620bp, suggesting the presence of an intron. The band was excised and purified with Millipore Ultra-free DA spin columns and stored @ -20C until a sequencing plate is readied.\nThe PCR reactions reveal the presence of intron(s) in the COX gene we’re investigating as well as providing evidence for the existence of multiple isoforms in C.gigas. Since the PCR products that have been excised for sequencing are so large, additional primers will need to be designed closer to the introns in order to generate smaller products that can be fully sequenced. Additionally, all reactions using the primer designed to anneal in the 5’UTR of COX (SR ID: 1150) failed to produce useful results. This is either due to poor performance of the primer under these reaction conditions or due to the presence of a large intron in the 5’ region of the gene. Additional reverse primers will be designed that anneal closer to the 5’ portion of the COX gene in hopes of characterizing the 5’ genomic sequence better.\nAfter speaking with Steven today about the potential existence/“discovery” of multiple isoforms, he decided to map the newly-released C.gigas 454 NGS data to the existing COX coding sequence in GenBank (FJ375303). The alignment is shown below.\n\nThe two 454 reads that map closest to the 5’ end of the COX coding sequence match up nearly perfectly, with periodic SNPs. The remaining 454 reads that map to the COX coding sequence are very different and provide very good evidence of a previously unidentified isoform of COX in C.gigas. Primers will be designed from both the existing COX sequence in GenBank (FJ375303) and the other potential isoform. These primers will likely be used in both qPCR and for sequencing purposes, in order to be able to distinguish and characterize both isoforms. Additionally, BLASTing will be performed with the sequences from both isoforms to evaluate how they match up with existing COX isoforms in other species."

Additionally, the Clontech polymerase used was nearly 6 years old. The kit (and its components) are of an unknown age and could factor in to the failure of this procedure. Also, the primers that were designed had less than ideal Tm, per the kit’s recommendations.\nMay need to sequence some previously purified potential COX2 fragments in order to obtain a more useable region of the gene for RACE."

    "text": "Due to an apparent reduction in assay sensitivity for the Hematodidium qPCR assay, we have decided to determine if the spec readings of the plasmid DNA being used for the standard curves are accurate. Used C.gigas gDNA and the lambda DNA Standard (100ng/uL) included in the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) that was marked as received 9/1/10. Tested both the Roberts Lab and Young Lab using these DNAs. At least 6 separate measurements were taken of each DNA on each machine. Samples were briefly mixed by flicking the tube 4-5 times prior to each measurement.\nResults:\nSpreadsheet containing absorbance data and calculations of average concentration and standard deviation for both DNA samples on both machines is here.\nA quick table of the results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts Lab\n\n\nYoung Lab\n\n\n\n\n[Avg. gDNA] (ng/uL)\n\n\n45.656\n\n\n51.778\n\n\n\n\nStd Dev gDNA\n\n\n0.2377\n\n\n0.5825\n\n\n\n\n[Avg. lambda DNA] (ng/uL)\n\n\n76.01\n\n\n90.255\n\n\n\n\nStd Dev lambda DNA\n\n\n3.826\n\n\n0.9342\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to notice is that the lambda DNA that has been used for standard curves does not have the expected concentration (100ng/uL) on either of the machines. It seems unlikely that BOTH NanoDrop1000s are incorrectly calibrated (which could be a possible explanation for why the lambda DNA is not matching the expected 100ng/uL). This is also supported by recent curves done on the Friedman Lab plate reader using this DNA by Lisa, Vanessa and Elene (data not shown). It’s also interesting to note that the lambda DNA also shows a greater standard deviation (on both machines) than the other DNA (gDNA) used in this test. This is surprising as one would expect a store-bought reagent to be of the highest quality, particularly since it is supposed to be used for DNA quantification. However, it should also be remembered that this DNA is over a year old and has never been aliquoted. As such, it has gone through an extremely high number of freeze/thaw cycles which could have an impact on the long-term quality of the DNA.\nThe second thing to notice is that the Roberts Lab and Young Lab machines provide different concentrations of each of the two DNAs. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the lambda DNA concentration is not as expected (100ng/uL) on either machine it is impossible to determine which machine is more accurate. However, it appears that the Young Lab NanoDrop1000, overall, is more consistently precise in its readings than the Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000. Of course, both machines do seem to be sufficiently precise that precision shouldn’t be a concern.\nI’ve notified Lisa of the potentially inaccurate readings of the lambda DNA. She has ordered a fresh set of DNA standards that will be used to test both machines to help assess their accuracy."

The master mix was mixed well and 10uL were distributed in each well of ABI plates. Plates were sealed with ABI optical adhesive covers.\nIt should also be noted that this analysis was only done with a single primer set and was not tested on any other qPCR machines. This can easily be done if it is desired, however I think one of the issues still being observed with the machine is sample-independent (see Results section below).\nResults:\nHere’s an extremely quick and dirty analysis of what these qPCR runs have revealed (across the entire plate, 3 plates of data):\nAvg. Range of Cts Across Plates - 1.70\nAvg. Std. Deviation of Cts Across Plates - 0.352\nBased off of the graphs below (particularly the Ct vs Well Position plot), my conclusion is that the machine reads plates inaccurately in Rows A, B, C, F, G, & H. Rows D & E exhibit the most consistent well-to-well readings and, potentially, could be used for qPCR.\nThe entire work up (which includes a breakdown of each well position relative to each other) is here (Excel Workbook .xlsx). Below are screen captures of one of the three plates (as an example, since all looked the same) that were used for analysis of the amplification plots, melt curves and Ct vs Well Position and a quick description/assessment of what I have observed.\nThe amplification plot (below) clearly shows the type of spread in Cts across an entire plate that was observed in each run, as well as a large range in fluorescence detected (Rn) in each well.\n\nThe melt curve (below) reflects the large range of detected fluorescence seen in the amplification plot. Additionally, some wells exhibit small “bumps” between 75C and 80C. This provides more evidence for a problem with well-to-well consistency.\n\nA graph of Ct vs. Well Position (below) reveals some enlightening information. From looking at this plot, it’s clear that the machine reads from A1 to A12, then B1 to B12 (reads by row, not column) and so on. This plot reveals that most of the variation seen in Ct values occurs in the two rows closest to the edge of the plate, and within those rows, the middle wells’ Cts are more similar to the Cts observed throughout the rest of the plate."

Due to this, all samples were vortexed for 1min in 1mL of TriReagent.

Samples were treated normally with the following changes:\n\nAqueous phase after chloroform treatment was clear, but grey in color. This is not necessarily unusual.\nAddition of isopropanol triggered immediate precipitation of a dark grey material.\n“Pelleting” of the RNA after the isopropanol precipitation resulted in a gooey grey material that did NOT pellet, and a clear supernatant. The grey goo was transferred to a clean tube. An additional 500uL of isopropanol was added to the clear supernatant of two samples (#140 & #142), as well as to the grey goo. The addition of isopropanol to the clear supe resulted in an immediate precipitation of white salt-like material. The isopropanol appeared to have no effect on the grey goo. All samples were stored @-20C in their existing conditions until 20120116.\nSince the two samples that were treated with an additional 500uL of isopropanol produced an excess of salt precipitation, I instead added 1mL of 70% EtOH to all the remaining samples; both the clear supernatants and the grey goo. The idea being that the higher water content in the 70% EtOH would help to keep the salts in solution, while precipitating the RNA. Samples were pelleted. All of the grey goo samples produced a white pellet. The grey goo seemed unchanged. Supernatants (including grey goos) were discarded and the resulting pellets from all samples were washed in this fashion were washed three more times.\nPellets were resuspended in 25uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O and stored @ -80C until 20120123.\nSamples were spec’d on the Roberts’ Lab NanoDrop 1000.\n\nResults:\nSpreadsheet of OD readings is here.\nSince samples were split into two (clear supernatant and grey goo), they were kept separate through the remainder of the process. Sample names are appended with “-1” or “-2”. “-1” samples are grey goo samples and the “-2” samples are the clear supernatant samples.\nOverall, most of the grey goo samples appear to have produced the highest yields and highest quality of RNA, although this is not true for all of the samples."

As such, the default baseline analysis setting (linear) suggested that all samples had a Cq value because the baseline was incorrectly set an was NOT above background fluorescence levels. Changing the baseline analysis setting to “regression” resolved this. Also, it should be noted that one sample (#48) other than the positive control actually does show amplification and a corresponding melt curve. However, the melt curve peak is at a different temp than the positive control, suggesting that this is non-specific amplification in sample #48."

    "text": "After submission of QPX samples to HTGU for Illumina library prep yesterday, I was notified that there was insufficient RNA for the QPX RNA samples. I checked the source RNA on the Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000 and determined that they had high phenol contamination (large peak at 270nm), which results in a large exaggeration in the OD260 absorbance (NanoDrop1000 report[JPEG]; notice terrible OD260/280 ratios; did not save screen shot of absorbance peaks.). As such, the concentrations that Lexie had listed in her notebook for these samples are highly inaccurate and highly inflated. To remove the phenol, I brought all of her QPX RNA samples from 20110504 up to ~200uL with 0.1%DEPC-H2O, added 200uL of chloroform, vortexed for 30s, spun at 12,500g RT for 15mins, and transferred aqueous phase to new tube. Then performed an ethanol precipitation on the aqueous phase. Added 0.1 vols of 3.0M sodium acetate (pH = 5.2), 2.5 vols of 100% EtOH, mixed and incubated at -20C for 1hr. Pelleted RNA by spinning at 16,000g 4C for 15mins.\nResults:\n\nAs suspected, most of these samples have absolutely no RNA in them. However, the samples that do (the “Control” samples), look great! Pooled 2ug each of the RT Control a & b samples and pooled 2ug each of the 10C Control a & b samples (which are ATCC). Calculations are here. Will take them down to HTGU tomorrow to replace the bad samples that were provided yesterday."

Will discuss with Steven on how to proceed.\nUPDATE 20121031 - Dave emailed and indicated the experimented started on 7/27/2011. Additionally, the two sample sets that are complete are Day 2 and Day 7. Discussing with Steven, we have decided to run a few genes and see how the expression levels compare to the NGS data analysis for these samples. If the qPCR data supports the NGS data, then that information will be relayed to the BMC Genomics reviewers in response to their critiques.

A single, high molecular weight band is present (albeit, faint) with almost no smearing. However, I’m disappointed by the lack of definition in the band.

Not surprisingly, Mac’s sample didn’t clean up nearly as nicely as Claire’s, based on my observations of the odd behavior during EtOH precipitation.\nAnd, despite the nice, clean looking peaks, the 260/280 ratios are actually WORSE than the original isolation. Will run on gel for a further assessment of quality/integrity.\nLoaded 5uL of each sample (~600ng) on a 1.0% agarose, 1x modified TAE gel stained with ethidium bromide.\n\nGel Layout:\nLane 1 - Hyperladder I (Bioline)\nLane 2 - Claire’s CgF gonad sample\nLane 3 - Mac’s gonad sample\nUsed Hyperladder I this time, which has a high molecular weight band of 10kb and a low molecular weight band of 200bp.\nWell, this totally sucks. Both samples appear to consist of nothing but 150-200bp fragments. Is something actually degrading these samples? The Buffer EB I used during the initial extraction is certainly old. Possible source of degradation? Ugh. Maybe I’ll try this again, but resuspend in TE…"

In order to separate them from the RNA Later, I used a fine mesh (don’t know mesh size; bag was labeled “Unknown”) as a “guard” between the pipette tip and the larvae. Removed RNA Later from those two groups in this fashion. However, a significant portion of the larvae in these tubes adhered to the outside of the mesh. I left the mesh “guard” in the tube, added 1mL of TriReagent and vortexed. The mesh quickly dissolved in the TriReagent, creating a milky white mix.\nFor the settlers samples, there was a such a large pellet already in the existing tubes, I just took ~75uL of this material, transferred to a clean tube and added 1mL of TriReagent. However, most of the debris that I transferred dissolved extremely quickly. I was expecting there to more insoluble “debris”, because marine bivalve larval shells generally don’t readily dissolve in the presence of TriReagent. So, I suspect that much of the settlers samples is not really geoduck larvae.\nDue to time constraints, stored all samples O/N @-80C in TriReagent.\nSamples were thawed and RNA was isolated, and DNased, using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit (ZymoResearch), eluted with 50uL of 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O, and spec’d on the NanoDrop1000.\nPrior to isolation, sample V1 showed a clear phase separation that none of the other samples exhibited. Sample V1 had a pink, goopy layer on top of a clear, low-viscosity layer. All other samples retained the uniform pink coloration imparted by the TriReagent. Additionally, after addition of the EtOH in the procedure to sample V1, a large amount of white precipitate formed and settled to the bottom of the tube. This did not happen in any other samples.\nSamples were stored @ -80C in “Shellfish RNA Box #5”\nResults:\n\nOverall, the yields are relatively low, as expected. Virtually all of the samples have poor OD260/280 values. Although not shown, there was a consistent shift in peak absorbance from 260nm towards 270nm, leading to the poor OD260/280 values."

The low molecular weight bands/smears are possibly RNA carryover and/or degraded DNA. Will discuss with Steven and then, most likely, bring downtown for Illumina sequencing.\nUPDATE 20140508: Downtown sequencing facility says there’s only ~800ng of DNA! This is a far cry from the minimum amount needed for sequencing (6ug). Looking at the gel above and comparing sample band intensity to the ladder band intensities suggests that the downtown sequencing facility is correct. I loaded 10uL of DNA on the gel and the intensity of the high molecular weight band is similar to the 400bp band intensity. This corresponds to 40ng of DNA. That means the CgF gDNA band is 40ng/10uL = 4ng/uL. I resuspended the gDNA pellet in 200uL of TE, so 200uL x 4ng/uL = 800ng; exactly what the sequencing facility says they measured…\nI’m not entirely sure what is happening here. Until very recently, there were almost never such egregious differences between the NanoDrop measurements and what they were measuring downtown at the sequencing facility. It seems as though they have changed the way they quantify samples (possibly using an Agilent Bioanalyzer instead of the Life Technologies Qubit fluorometer?), but this doesn’t mean their measurements are incorrect. However, I’m starting to suspect that the reason the initial sequencing of this sample was due to an overestimation of the quantity of input DNA (since I believe they were still using the fluorometer back then).\nAs such, it’s become clear that C.gigas gonad samples seem to yield poor quantities of gDNA, relative to the amount of input material. Additionally, there may be insufficient sample left to generate a useable quantity of gDNA to complete this resequencing effort."

Supe was discarded and pellets were resuspended in Low TE Buffer, spec’d on NanoDrop1000 and run on a gel (10uL of each sample).\nResults:\n\nYields look good and OD260/280 values look excellent. Most of the OD260/230 values aren’t good, but they rarely are.\n\nGel Loading:\nLane 1 - Hyperladder I (Bioline)\nLane 2 - EV2 16.go\nLane 3 - EV2 20.go\nLane 4 - EV2 22.go\nLane 5 - EV2 24.go\nLane 6 - EV2 28.go\nLane 7 - EV2 29.go\nLane 8 - EV2 32.go\nLane 9 - EV2 33.go\nLane10- Hyperladder I (Bioline)\nAll samples (excluding EV2 22.go) look pretty good, with minimal smearing. All samples exhibit low molecular weight smear which is either degraded DNA or residual RNA carryover. EV2 22.go had very little tissue, so yields were expected to be extremely low. However, I was anticipating to be able to visualize it on the gel (loaded 10uL = ~90ug)."

Data from this was received 20150629.\n\n\nBS-Seq Illumina Data Assembly/Mapping – C.gigas larvae OA\nLittle progress. No response from Univ. of Oregon. However, it seems that Mac has been having a similar issue with libraries constructed using Epigentek kits. She has contacted Illumina and Epigentek for help.\n\n\nGeoduck & Olympia Oyster Genome Sequencing\nNo progress. Purchasing personnel (both departmental and university) appear to have had difficulty contacting BGI. I have put both purchasing personnel in contact with the BGI rep (Frank Hu), so things are starting to progress. Still not certain why they were unable to accomplish this.\n\n\nMiscellany\nGoal(s):\n\nMigrate Wikispaces notebook to this notebook\nAdd to GitHub code pages\nFlesh out/create README files on server(s)\nLab cleanup tasks\nAssist on Jonathan’s Capstone project\nEstablish go-to location for lab personnel questions\nTeach Unix shell at Software Carpentry\n\nStatus:\n\nMigrate Wikispaces notebook to this notebook – Minimal progress\nAdd to GitHub code pages – Updated “Commercial Protocols”, improved wget command for offline notebook backups\nFlesh out/create README files on server(s) – Some progress, but mostly on the notebook backups and newly received transcriptomic data. No progress on older directories.\nLab cleanup tasks – Partial progress. Autoclaved multiple bags of old autoclave trash.\nAssist on Jonathan’s Capstone project – Improved my time management working with Jonathan, but his sequencing results are a bit odd and he needs guidance on how to manipulate, and comprehend, what the data means.\nSuccessfully taught both the shell and GitHub at Software Carpentry.\n\n\n\n\n\nO.lurida RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription\nNeed to isolate RNA from a set of Jake’s mechanically-stressed oyster tissue. Need to clarify with Steven if we want the 1hr post-mechanically stressed to “match” with the 1hr heat shock samples that were previously processed, or if we want the 24hr post-mechanically stressed samples.\n\n\nMiscellany\nNeed to address short-falls from the EH&S annual lab inspection. Most are minor, easily addressed issues and won’t take much time (e.g. print lab safety signs in color). The various computer tasks still stand: notebook migration from Wikispaces to this notebook, transitioning lab resources from Wikispaces to GitHub, creating/updating “readme” files for directories on our servers, etc. Lab organization goals: improve -80C organization and create an online inventory of the -80C, establish an online inventory of lab supply locations (i.e. thermometers can be found in FTR209, Drawer #02), general clean up."

    "text": "In an attempt to obtain the most accurate measurement of Claire’s sheared, heat shock mantle DNA, I quantified the samples using a third method: fluorescence.\nSamples were quantified using the Quant-It DNA BR Kit (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) according the manufacturer’s protocol. Standards were run in triplicate. Due to low sample volumes, only 1μL of each sample was used and was not replicated.\nPlate was read on a Perkin Elmer plate reader using the Wallac software. The plate was measured three times, with each well measured for a one second duration on each read.\nResults:\nSpreadsheet: 20150303_gigasHSshearedDNApico\nComparison of NanoDrop1000, Bioanalyzer, and fluorescence measurements:\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\nNanoDrop (ng/μL)\n\n\nBioanalyzer (ng/μL)\n\n\nFluorescence (ng/μL)\n\n\n\n\n2M sheared\n\n\n48.03\n\n\n16.28\n\n\n4.91\n\n\n\n\n4M sheared\n\n\n190.96\n\n\n58.52\n\n\n48.10\n\n\n\n\n6M sheared\n\n\n141.56\n\n\n42.98\n\n\n28.42\n\n\n\n\n2MHS sheared\n\n\n221.93\n\n\n32.45\n\n\n13.48\n\n\n\n\n4MHS sheared\n\n\n257.48\n\n\n43.82\n\n\n11.75\n\n\n\n\n6MHS sheared\n\n\n202.02\n\n\n51.12\n\n\n8.97\n\n\n\n\n\nNot entirely surprising, but the fluorescence method is clearly the most conservative measurement of the three methods. However, I do find the difference between the Bioanalyzer and fluorescence measurements very surprising. I suspected the Bioanalyzer would underestimate the concentrations because I actively selected which peak regions to measure, possibly leaving out some aspect of the sample.\nRegardless, will use the most conservative measurements (fluorescence) for decision making.\nWith our yields, we have insufficient DNA to conduct MeDIP and then subsequent bisulfite conversion and library prep on our own. The recovery from the MeDIP will result in too little input DNA for bisulfite conversion and, in turn, library prep.\nHowever, we do have sufficient quantities of starting DNA (>200ng) for Epigentek’s MeDIP Methyl-seq. I have contacted Epigentek to see if their procedure includes bisulfite conversion after MeDIP (which the website workflow suggests that it does not)."

However, this is probably moot since these two samples will be pooled shortly.\nI’m not going to speculate why there’re weird peaks at 240nm…\nThe two “fluff” samples aren’t good (extremely high 260/280 ratios, very low 260/230 ratios, and weird peak at 240nm). Not sure what the fluff is that precipitated out with the EtOH addition. Will discard them.\nThe two normal samples look fine.

This confounds library quantification (because both the intended PCR product and the primer dimers contribute to the fluorescence accumulation), as well as potentially interfering with the subsequent Illumina sequencing (primer dimers will be sequenced and contain no insert sequence).\n\nWill repeat the qPCR with more appropriately diluted libraries.\nSee the info below for more deets on this run.\nDefault analysis settings need to be adjusted to account for how early the standard curve comes up. Otherwise, the Opticon software sets the baseline incorrectly:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/201501116_RAD_qPCR_01.png)\nThe KAPA Quantification Kit indicates that the baseline calculations need to be extended to cycles 1 through 3. This allows the software to set the baseline threshold correctly:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/201501116_RAD_qPCR_02.png)\nMelt curve analysis of the standard curve shows the expected profile - slight hump leading into the peak:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/201501116_RAD_qPCR_std_melt.png)\nMelt curve analysis of the libraries. Dual peaks indicate primer dimer contamination:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/201501116_RAD_qPCR_library_melt_01.png)\nMelt curve analysis of Oly RAD Library 30. Shows the desired single peak, suggesting library is free of primer dimers:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/201501116_RAD_qPCR_library_melt_02.png)"

As can be seen in the plots above, there is clearly significant absorbance in the 230 - 250nm, suggesting some contaminant carryover (phenol/salt). Oddly, the side-by-side isolations from two different collections of the same tissue type yielded drastically different quantities of gDNA than each other.\nWill evaluate gDNA integrity on agarose gel.\nTotal yield from this isolation is still far below the minimum quantity of gDNA needed for the sequencing project.

Intact, high molecular weight band. My only concern is the noticeable difference in band intensities between these two. Both samples should be ~300ng/μL, based on the NanoDrop1000 readings. However, it’s evident that the concentrations of these two samples differ greatly. Additionally, we can use the ladder to gauge the concentrations of the samples, since I loaded 0.5μg of the ladder, which is the quantity referenced on the ladder guide above.\nIt would appear that the geoduck sample concentration is closer to 60ng/μL (band intensity is similar to that of the 500, 1000, & 3000bp markers), as opposed to the 292ng/μL that the NanoDrop1000 indicated.\nThe Oly sample appears to have even less and appears less intense than the lowest concentration bands on the marker (16.0ng/μL). That’s not even remotely close to the 331ng/μL measured by the NanoDrop1000.\nIt’s difficult to say why this might be, as both samples were RNased and neither of them show extensive smearing (both of those factors would contribute to inflated spec readings).\nRegardless, will ship them off to BGI to supplement the previous gDNA for this project.\nEthanol-Preserved Samples\nBoth samples show extensive smearing and no high molecular weight band, indicating they are both completely degraded. This is a very bad result for this project, as the tissue in this group is/was a bit of grasping at straws to obtain some intact DNA to use for the RAD-seq that we intend to pursue."

Interestingly, the 260/230 ratios aren’t so great (compared to yesterday’s isolations). I suspect that the reason for this is that there appeared to be more starting tissue in these samples than yesterday’s. The greater quantity of tissue explains the higher yields and could be tied to the decrease in the 260/230 ratios…\nAnyway, things look good. Next step will be to check for gDNA carryover in these samples and yesterday’s samples."

    "title": "Goals - May 2015",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Here are the things I plan to tackle throughout the month of May:\n\nGeoduck Reproductive Development Transcriptomics\nMy primary goal for this project is to successfully isolate RNA from the remaining, troublesome paraffin blocks that have yet to yield any usable RNA. The next approach to obtain usable quantities of RNA is to directly gouge tissue from the blocks instead of sectioning the blocks (as recommended in the PAXgene Tissue RNA Kit protocol). Hopefully this approach will eliminate excess paraffin, while increasing the amount of input tissue. Once I have RNA from the entire suite of samples, I’ll check the RNA integrity via Bioanalyzer and then we’ll decide on a facility to use for high-throughput sequencing.\n\n\nBS-Seq Illumina Data Assembly/Mapping\nCurrently, there are two projects that we have performed BS-Seq with (Crassostrea gigas larvae OA (2011) bisulfite sequencing and LSU C.virginica Oil Spill MBD BS Sequencing) and we’re struggling to align sequences to the C.gigas genome. Granted, the LSU samples are C.virginica, but the C.gigas larvae libraries are not aligning to the C.gigas genome via standard BLASTn or using a dedicated bisulfite mapper (e.g. BS-Map). I’m currently BLASTing a de-novo assembly of the C.gigas larvae OA 400ppm sequencing that Steven made against the NCBI nt DB in an attempt to assess the taxonomic distribution of the sequences we received back. I’ll also try using a different bisulfite mapper, bismark, that Mackenzie Gavery has previously used and has had better results with than BS-Map.\n\n\nC.gigas Heat Stress MeDIP/BS-Seq\nAs part of Claire’s project, there’s still some BS-Seq data that would be nice to have to complement the data she generated via microarray. It would be nice to make a decision about how to proceed with the samples. However, part of our decision on how to proceed is governed by the results we get from the two projects above. Why do those two projects impact the decision(s) regarding this project? They impact this project because in the two projects above, we produced our own BS-Seq libraries. This is extremely cost effective. However, if we can’t obtain usable data from doing the library preps in-house, then that means we have to use an external service provider. Using an external company to do this is significantly more expensive. Additionally, not all companies can perform bisulfite treatment, which limits our choices (and, in turn, pricing options) on where to go for sequencing.\n\n\nMiscellany\nWhen I have some down time, I’ll continue working on migrating my Wikispaces notebook to this notebook. I only have one year left to go and it’d be great is all my notebook entries were here so they’d all be tagged/categorized and, thus, be more searchable. I’d also like to work on adding README files to our plethora of electronic data folders. Having these in place will greatly facilitate the ability of people to quickly and more easily figure out what these folders contain, file formats within those folders, etc. I also have a few computing tips/tricks that I’d like to add to our Github “Code” page. Oh, although this isn’t really lab related, I was asked to teach the Unix shell lesson (or, at least, part of it) at the next Software Carpentry Workshop that Ben Marwick is setting up at UW in early June. So, I’m thinking that I’ll try to incorporate some of the data handling stuff I’ve been tackling in lab in to the lesson I end up teaching. Additionally, going through the Software Carpentry materials will help reinforce some of the “fundamental” tasks that I can do with the shell (like find, cut and grep).\nIn the lab, I plan on sealing up our nearly overflowing “Broken Glass” box and establishing a new one. I need to autoclave, and dispose of, a couple of very full biohazard bags. I’m also going to vow that I will get Jonathan to finally obtain a successful PCR from his sea pen RNA."

Currently reaching out to Doug Turnbull at the Univ. of Oregon Genomics Core Facility to see if he can provide any insight as to why our data looks the way it does, which might help us figure out why we’re having such difficulty mapping our reads to the C.gigas genome…\n\n\nC.gigas Heat Stress MeDIP/BS-Seq\nGoal(s): BS-seq Claire’s samples.\nStatus: Untouched. Is dependent upon whether or not we can successfully create our own high-throughput sequencing libraries (see above).\n\n\nMiscellany\nGoal(s):\n\nMigrate Wikispaces notebook to this notebook\nAdd to GitHub code pages\nFlesh out/create README files on server(s)\nLab cleanup tasks\nAssist on Jonathan’s Capstone project\n\nStatus:\n\nMigrate Wikispaces notebook to this notebook - Minimal progress\nAdd to GitHub code pages - Updated “Commercial Protocols”, added wget command for offline notebook backups\nFlesh out/create README files on server(s) - No progress\nLab cleanup tasks - No progress\nAssist on Jonathan’s Capstone project - Things still not working. Had Jonathan isolate gDNA for proper testing of primers.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoduck Reproductive Development Transcriptomics\nThis project is progressing relatively smoothly. Finished RNA isolations from all samples and checked their qualities via Bioanalyzer. Steven and Brent selected samples of males and females to pool for RNA-seq. Goal is to have these two pools sent off to GENEWIZ, Inc. for RNA-seq. Currently awaiting a quote adjustment as well as an answer regarding sample quantity requirements. Hope to have these sent off later today and data back by the end of the month. This data will be used alongside proteomics data that Emma is currently generating.\n\n\nBS-Seq Illumina Data Assembly/Mapping - C.gigas larvae OA\nThe troubleshooting for the data from these “homemade” libraries continues. We’ve tried various approaches to trimming the data, but Steven’s mapping attempts are still not yielding great results. I’ve contacted Univ. of Oregon Genomics Core Facility to see if they can provide insight, but haven’t gotten a response. Will hit them up again to see if I can get a response (and some help).\n\n\nGeoduck & Olympia Oyster Genome Sequencing\nWe have quotes from BGI Americas for genome sequencing for both of these organisms. Currently, we’re awaiting for funding to be processed, but expect it to be available this month. Hope to send out samples this month.\n\n\nC.gigas Heat Stress MeDIP/BS-Seq\nThis is still dependent upon our ability to make our own BS-seq libraries. Until, then, this project will likely be on the back burner for awhile.\n\n\nMiscellany\nI’d like to continue to contribute to our GitHub code repository with various command line tips and tricks. Additionally, I do need to actually spend some time creating/updating README files for our servers. We have a ton of folders that need some sort of descriptor file in them so users know what to expect to find in those folders. Additionally, we have a ton of data that needs descriptions and/or links to the projects from which the data was generated to serve as a means for people to know how/why/from what the data was generated. This has been done for newer data sets, but there’s a tremendous amount of data sets that have no information about them available in the README files. Also along the data management front, I’d like to tackle a bit of a reorganization, particularly re-establishing the go-to resource for lab members to find “stuff.” For example, Jake recently needed to know where/if we had some software and had to ask about it. Better organization on our part would eliminate him wasting time trying to track down this sort of thing. Part of the organizational issue is that we’ve partially transitioned over to using GitHub instead of Wikispaces. However, the transition hasn’t been fully realized/implemented and the result is fragmentation and confusion on where to find lab info. Oh, one last “digital” note. I’ll be teaching the Unix Shell lesson at Software Carpentry on June 25 - 26, so I have to get prepped for that (not on work time, of course).\nIn the lab, I still need to tackle some lab cleanup tasks that I neglected to deal with last month (autoclaving, glass disposal). Additionally, I need to continue helping Jonathan with his Capstone project, but I need to manage my time with him better."

As it turns out, when multiplexed libraries are sequenced using the Illumina platform, an index read step needs to be “enabled” on the machine for sequencing. Otherwise, the machine does not perform the index read step (since it wouldn’t be necessary for a single library). Surprisingly, the sample submission form for the Univ. of Oregon Genomics Core Facility  doesn’t request any information regarding whether or not a submitted sample has been multiplexed. However, by default, they enable the index read step on all sequencing runs.

However, Katherine informed me that she’s just been pulling up the Meyer Lab page to reference the protocol. So, it’s possible they made a change to the file after I initially downloaded it, but the change wasn’t indicated in the file name.\nhttps://people.oregonstate.edu/~meyere/docs/\nHowever, when discussing with Katherine, she made a good point and said she just scaled up the test-scale PCR. Since the test-scale PCR was successful, she didn’t see a need to make any changes.\nWill try this procedure again with the correct protocol; probably by scaling up the test-scale PCR."

    "text": "I recently ran gDNA isolated for geoduck and Olympia oyster genome sequencing, as well as gDNA isolated from the Olympia oyster reciprocal transplant experiment out on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using the DNA 12000 chips. The results from the chip were a bit confusing and difficult to assess exactly what was going on with the DNA.\nSo, I ran 5μL of each of those samples on a 0.8% agarose 1x modified TAE gel w/EtBr to get a better look at how the samples actually looked.\nResults:\n(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sr320/LabDocs/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ThermoFisher_OgeneRuler_DNA_Ladder_Mix_F100439.jpg)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20151113_gel_gDNA.png)\nBoth the geoduck and the Olympia oyster samples for genome sequencing show intact, high molecular weight bands with some smearing (i.e. degradation). The oly sample looks a bit funky, most likely due to a gel anomaly. I’ll quantify these using a dye-based method for a more accurate quantification before sending off to BGI.\nThe Fidalgo 2SN samples all have intact, high molecular weight bands, but most of the samples show extensive smearing (i.e. degradation). However, sample 2SN 35 has no visible DNA at all.\nHere’s a table highlighting the differences between the Fidalgo gDNA samples:\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\nFresh/Frozen\n\n\nIsolator\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nFresh\n\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nFresh\n\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nFresh\n\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nFresh\n\n\nMrunmayee\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nFresh\n\n\nMrunmayee\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nFresh\n\n\nMrunmayee\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\nFrozen\n\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\nFrozen\n\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\nFrozen\n\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\nFrozen\n\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fresh ctenidia samples were isolated by me on 20151021 and by Mrunmayee on 20151023. The frozen ctenidia samples were isolated by me on 20151103.\nIt’s interesting to note that Mrunmayee’s isolations appear to exhibit the least amount of degradation. Besides her handling the samples, the primary difference is that her samples were incubated in the buffer/Pro K solution O/N @ 37C, while my fresh samples were incubated @ 60C for 3hrs and my frozen samples were incubated @ 60C for 1hr. Overall, though, the frozen samples look the worst.\nFinally, it’s also interesting to see that the two samples isolated using DNazol (geoduck and Olympia oyster genome samples) migrate more slowly than the remaining Olympia oyster samples which were isolated with the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit."

This is good, but the amount of RNA from these is probably borderline sufficient quantity for RNA-Seq.\nThe kit has enough columns for six sample preps. I think I’ll attempt this strategy again (gouging/shaving directly from tissue in histo cassette), but really take a fair amount of tissue this time and see if I can get more.\nAll samples were stored @ -80C in Shellfish RNA Box #5."

Used 1μL of each sample.\nResults:\n(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sr320/LabDocs/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ThermoFisher_OgeneRuler_DNA_Ladder_Mix_F100439.jpg)\nThe results are not good. Every sample exhibits serious degradation (the smearing that’s present in each lane). There should be a distinct, high molecular weight band with no smearing if the gDNA was high quality and intact. These extractions also served as a comparison in slight differences in the extraction procedure (homogenization with & without mortar/pestle), as described in Steven’s post. However, those differences seem to have no impact on the quality of the resulting gDNA.\nI [isolated gDNA from Ostrea lurida tissue samples two weeks ago using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek)(2015/09/01/agarose-gel-geoduck-olympia-oyster-gdna-integrity-check.html) and didn’t see this level of degradation. Additionally, Katherine Silliman used the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA Kit to isolate gDNA from Ostrea lurida larvae and obtained high quality gDNA in virtually all of her samples. Below is my gel and Katherine’s gel for quick comparison to the one above:\n[caption id=“” align=“alignleft” width=“301”](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150901_gDNA_geoduck_oly.jpg) Ostrea lurida gDNA isolated from adductor muscle & mantle tissues (lanes 4 & 5). Despite low quantity loading, notice that smearing below high molecular weight bands is limited to a low molecular weight range.[/caption]\n[caption id=“” align=“alignleft” width=“213”](https://marinegenes.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/gel_9_11_15.jpg?w=584) Katherine’s gel of Ostrea lurida gDNA isolated from larvae.[/caption]\nI can’t be certain what is causing this issue. We previously had this same issue with a different group of Ostrea lurida whole body gDNA isolations (using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit [Qiagen]). Two different kits using whole bodies and both sets of extractions have produced similarly bad results. It’s certainly possible that some nastiness (that’s a scientific term, btw) is being introduced by using whole body instead of specific tissues.\nAnother possible contributor to the DNA degradation we’ve seen is how the samples were collected and stored. I’m not up-to-date on exactly how the preservation was accomplished, but I do know that the Ostrea lurida whole body samples I previously worked with were just masses of black when I removed them from shells/tubes for isolation. So, in that case, it wasn’t terribly surprising that that the gDNA obtained from those was degraded. It should also be noted that Katherine’s extraction were from whole larvae that had been stored in RNAlater. Although a direct comparison cannot be made due to the difference in developmental stage between Katherine’s samples and these, it lends some evidence to the possibility that sample collection/storage is a contributor to the degraded gDNA we’re obtaining from whole body oyster extractions. However, with that being said, I’m not sure what the collection and storage background is on this particular set of samples."

    "text": "I previously checked Claire’s sheared DNA on the Bioanalyzer to verify the fragment size and to quantify the samples. Looking at her notebook, her numbers differ greatly from the Bioanalyzer, possibly due to the fact that the DNA1000 assay chip used only measures DNA fragments up to 1000bp in size. If her shearing was incomplete, then there would be DNA fragments larger than 1000bp that wouldn’t have been measured by the Bioanalyzer. So, I decided to quantify the samples on the NanoDrop1000 (ThermoFisher) again.\nResults:\nSpreadsheet: 20150226_Claire_sheared_Emma_1000ppm_OD260s\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150226_Claire_sheared_Emma_1000ppm_plots.JPG)\nComparison of NanoDrop1000 and Bioanalyzer measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\nNanoDrop (ng/μL)\n\n\nBioanalyzer (ng/μL)\n\n\n\n\n2M sheared\n\n\n48.03\n\n\n16.28\n\n\n\n\n4M sheared\n\n\n190.96\n\n\n58.52\n\n\n\n\n6M sheared\n\n\n141.56\n\n\n42.98\n\n\n\n\n2MHS sheared\n\n\n221.93\n\n\n32.45\n\n\n\n\n4MHS sheared\n\n\n257.48\n\n\n43.82\n\n\n\n\n6MHS sheared\n\n\n202.02\n\n\n51.12\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NanoDrop is known to overestimate sample quantities due to the indiscriminate nature of UV spectrophotometry and that could be the reason for the large discrepancy between the two measurements (i.e. RNA carryover may lead to overestimation). As such, I’ll quantify the samples using a fluorescence-based assay for double stranded DNA tomorrow in hopes of getting the most accurate measurement."

Added additional 300μL of RNAzol RT to each.\nNOTE: 0.1% DEPC-H2O used throughout this procedure was prepared on 7/15/2010 by me.\nAccording to Jake’s notebook entry, the samples should have been previously homogenized in RNAzol RT. However, none of the samples showed evidence of being homogenized:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Pics/20150506_Oly_tissue_RNAzol.JPG)\nIn theory, if these samples were snap frozen on liquid nitrogen after being placed in the RNAzol RT, there should be almost no impact on the RNA.\nProcedure:\nSamples were homogenized with disposable pestle in their respective tubes and vortexed.\nAdded 400μL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O to each sample and vortexed 15s.\nIncubated samples 15mins at RT.\nCentrifuged tubes 15mins at RT @ 16,000g.\n750μL of the supe was transferred to a clean tube, added equal volume of isopropanol (750μL), mix by inversion (20 times), and incubated at RT for 15mins.\nCentrifuged 12,000g for 10mins.\nDiscarded supe.\nWashed pellets with 500μL of 75% EtOH (made with 0.1% DEPC-H2O) and centrifuged 4,000g for 3mins at RT. Repeated one time.\nRemoved EtOH and resuspended in  100μL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O. Most samples required vortexing to dissolve pellet.\nSample tubes were transferred to ice, quantified on the Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000, and stored @ -80C in their original box, pictured:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Pics/20150506_Jake_Oly_RNA_box.JPG)\nResults:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150506_Jake_Oly_1h_HS_RNA_ODs.JPG)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150506_Jake_Oly_1h_HS_RNA_plots-01.JPG)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150506_Jake_Oly_1h_HS_RNA_plots-02.JPG)\nGoogle Spreadsheet with absorbance data: 20150506_Jake_Oly_1h_HS_RNA_ODs\nOverall, the samples have excellent yields. The exceptions being the two samples that had less than 1mL of RNAzol RT in them to start (their yields are actually fine, but relative to all the other samples, they aren’t great). Should I have left them that way instead of adding additional RNAzol RT? Was there something wrong with these samples in the first place and that’s why they didn’t have a full 1mL of RNAzol RT in the tube already?\nThe 260/280 ratios are pretty good for most of the samples (>1.8), however I’d prefer to see RNA with 260/280 ratios >1.9.\nThe 260/230 ratios are amazing! The best I’ve seen coming straight out of an RNA isolation in a long time.\nEventually (once I’ve isolated RNA from the control set that corresponds to these heat shock samples), I’ll check for gDNA carryover and then, probably, DNase the RNA."

This sample used 630ng. The reason for this was due to the fact that there weren’t any other female samples to use from this developmental time point. The two other developmental time points each had three samples contributing to the pool. So, three times the quantity of the other individual samples was used to help equalize the time point contribution to the pooled sample. Additionally, 630ng used the entirety of sample #08.\nThe male RNA pool used 315ng of each sample. This number differs from the 210ng used for the female RNAs so that the two pools would end up with the same total quantity of RNA. However, now that I’ve typed this, this doesn’t matter since the libraries will be equalized before being run on the Illumina HiSeq2500. Oh well.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We had our first true test of the Synology RAID redundancy with our Synology 1812+ server (Owl). One of the hard drives (HDD) failed. All of the other drives were fine, the data was intact and we had a new replacement HDD on hand. However, there was one shortcoming: no email notification of the drive failure. Luckily, the Synology server is next to Steven’s office and he could hear an audible beeping alerting him to the fact that something was wrong. In any case, the email notifications have been fixed and a replacement hard drive was added to the system. Here’s how these things were accomplished.\n\nFix email notifications\nThe system was previously set to use Steven’s Comcast SMTP server. Sending a test email from Owl failed, indicating authentication failure. I changed this to use the University of Washington’s email server for outgoing messages. Here’s how…\nIn the Synology Disk Station Manager (DSM):\nControl Panel > Notifications\n\nService provider: Custom SMTP Server\nSMTP server: smtp.washington.edu\nSMTP port: 587\nUsername: myUWnetID@uw.edu\nPassword: myUWpassword\n\nInteresting note, there’s a “Push Service” tab in the “Notifications” window. This allows you to have Synology send emails to email addresses when the server has an issue. This eliminates the need for the SMTP settings shown above which may not be easy to find and/or understand for a given email service provider. The “Push Service” appears to be much simpler and more user friendly to set up.\n\n\nHot Swap HDD\nWe’ve kept a backup HDD on hand for just this occasion, so the HDD failure wasn’t too concerning. Here’re the steps I followed to swap the HDD and have the Synology system initialize/build the new HDD:\nRemove the dead HDD and put the new HDD in.\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Synology_DiskStation_DS1812_Quick_Installation_Guide-_Syno_QIG_18bay_enu_pdf.jpg)\nInitialize/build/repair the new HDD.\nIn Synology DSM:\nStorage Manger > Volume\nNotice, there should be eight drives listed, but since one has died, only seven are shown:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150731_Owl01.jpg)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150731_Owl02.jpg)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150731_Owl03.jpg)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150731_Owl04.jpg)\nThat’s it! Easy breezy!\nI’ve checked with Seagate on the dead HDD and it is still under warranty. Will get that returned and also purchase a new backup drive to have on hand."

As can be seen in the plots above, there is clearly significant absorbance in the 230 – 250nm, suggesting some contaminant carryover (phenol/salt).\nWill evaluate gDNA integrity on agarose gel.\nYields from this isolation:\nAdductor muscle 1: 11.03μg\nAdductor muscle 2: 1.95μg\nFoot 1: 4.6μg\nFoot 2: 1.64μg\nTotal geoduck gDNA from this isolation: 19.2μg\nTotal geoduck gDNA accumulated for this project: 69μg\nStill need an additional 4μg at a minimum!

    "text": "To complement MBD ChiP-seq data and RNA-seq data that we have from this experiment, we want to generate, at a minimum, some BS-seq data from the same C.gigas individuals used for the other aspects of this experiment.  Claire had previously isolated DNA and sheared the DNA on 20140108. If possible, we’d like to perform MBD enrichment, but the current quantities of DNA may prevent us from this.\nTo quantify the DNA and evaluate the shearing profile, I ran 1μL of each of the following mantle pre-/post-heat shock samples on a DNA 1000 chip (Agilent) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. in the Seeb Lab:\nM = mantle HS = heat shocked\n\n2M sheared\n4M sheared\n6M sheared\n2M HS sheared\n4M HS sheared\n6M HS sheared\n\nResults:\nBioanalyzer Data File (XAD): 2100_expert_DNA_1000_DE72902486_2015-02-19_11-32-35 (2).xad\nElectropherograms:\n\n\n\n2100 Bioanalyzer electropherograms of Claire’s sheared C.gigas DNA\n\n\nSpreadsheet: 2100 expert_DNA 1000_DE72902486_2015-02-19_11-32-35_Results_001\nClaire’s notebook entry doesn’t ever specify what her target shear size was, but the Bioanalyzer analysis suggests an average size of ~500bp.\nAlso interesting to note is that Claire’s sample concentrations (as measured on the NanoDrop1000) are significantly greater than what is calculated by the Bioanalyzer. Since the Bioanalyzer chip used (DNA1000) only goes to 1000bp, is it possible the differences in concentrations is due to incomplete shearing of the samples (e.g. a significant portion of the DNA is >1000bp in size and thus not factored in to the Bioanlyzer concentrations calculations)?\nWill check sample volumes and determine total amount of remaining DNA for each sample and then assess how to proceed next (i.e. MBD or just BS-seq).\nUPDATE 20150226:\nSample volumes were measured and total quantity (ng) of DNA in each sample were added to the spreadsheet above.\nBased on the quantities of DNA we have for each sample, will discuss sequencing options (e.g. MBD or not, self-prepare libraries or not, etc) with Steven."

As can be seen in the plots above, there is clearly significant absorbance in the 230 - 250nm, suggesting some contaminant carryover (phenol/salt).\nWill evaluate gDNA integrity on agarose gel.\nTotal yield from this isolation is still below the minimum quantity of gDNA needed for the sequencing project.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We recently received Illumina HiSeq2500 data back from this project. Initially looking at the data, something seems off.  Using FASTQC, the quality drops of drastically towards the last 20 bases of the reads. We also see a high degree of Illumina TruSeq adaptor/index sequences present in our data.\nSince this sequencing run was multiplexed (i.e. multiple libraries were pooled and run together on the HiSeq), we need to demultiplex our sequences before performing any trimming. Otherwise, the trimming could remove the index (barcodes) sequences from the data and prevent us from separating out the different libraries from each other.\nHowever, it turns out, demultiplexing is not a simple, straightforward task. There are a variety of programs available and they all have different options. I decided to compare TruSeq index identification using two programs:\n-grep (grep is a built-in command line (bash) program that searches through files to find matches to user-provided information.) -fastx_barcode_splitter.pl (fastx_barcode_splitter.pl is a component of the fastx_tookit that searches through FASTQ files to identify matches to user-provided index/barcode sequences.)\nThe advantage(s) of using grep is that it’s extremely fast, easy to use, and already exists on most Unix-based computers (Linux, OS X), thus not requiring any software installation. The disadvantage(s) of using grep for a situation like this is that it is not amenable to allowing for mismatches and/or partial matches to the user-provided information.\nThe advantage(s) of using fastx_barcode_splitter.pl is that it can accept a user-defined number of mismatches and/or partial matches to the user-defined index/barcode sequences. The disadvantage(s) of using fastx_barcode_splitter.pl is that it requires the user to specify the expected location of the index/barcode sequence in the target sequence: either the beginning of the line or the end of the line. It will not search beyond the length(s) of the provided index/barcode sequences. That means if you index/barcode exists in the middle of your sequences, this program will not find it. Additionally, since this program doesn’t exist natively on Unix-based machines, it must be downloaded and installed by the user.\nSo, I tested both of these programs to see how they compared at matching both long (the TruSeq adaptor/index sequences identified with FASTQC) and “short” (the actual 6bp index sequence) barcodes.\nTo simplify testing, only a single sequence file was used from the data set.\nAll analysis was done in a Jupyter (IPython) notebook.\nFASTQC HTML file for easier viewing of FASTQC output.\nNBViewer version of embedded notebook below.\n\n\nResult:\n\ngrep\nlong barcodes: Found in ~12% of all reads\nshort barcodes: Found in ~25% of all reads\n\n\nfastx_barcode_splitter\nlong barcodes, beginning of line: Found in ~15% of all reads\nlong barcodes, end of line: Found in < 0.008% of all reads (yes, that is actually percentage)\nshort barcodes, beginning of line: Found in ~1.3% of all reads\nshort barcodes, end of line: Found in ~2.7% of all reads\nOverall, the comparison is interesting, however, the important take home from this is that in the best-case scenario (grep, short barcodes), we’re only able to identify 25% of the reads in our sequences!\nIt should also be noted that my analysis only used sequences in one orientation. It would be a good idea to also do this analysis by searching with the reverse and reverse complements of these sequences."

Not too much smearing, but accumulation of low molecular weight smudge suggests residual RNA. This is despite the fact that the kit used for isolation (E.Z.N.A.

Some smearing (i.e. degradation) present, along with degarded DNA visible at ~500bp.

Some smearing and a smudge around 500bp, indicating degraded DNA. The low visibility of this sample on the gel suggests that the concentration determined by the NanoDrop1000 is inaccurate.

As such, 5μL of each reaction was pulled immediately after the extension (72C – machine was paused) of cycles 12, 17, 22, & 27 in order to determine the ideal number of cycles to use. Also ran the ligation reactions (labeled “Ligations” on the gel below) of the samples as a pre-PCR comparison. Treated them the same as the PCR reactions: mixed 8μL of the ligation with 12μL of H2O, used 5μL of that mix to load on gel.\nThese samples were run on a 1x modified TAE 2% agarose gel (w/EtBr).\nResults:\n(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sr320/LabDocs/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ThermoFisher_OgeneRuler_DNA_Ladder_Mix_F100439.jpg)\n[caption id=“” align=“alignnone” width=“698”](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20151012_RAD_test_scale_PCR.jpg) Test-scale PCR gel. Green arrow indicates desired band. The numbers below the headings indicate the sample number.[/caption]\nThis looks pretty good. The green arrow on the gel indicates the desired band size (~166bp). Although difficult to see on this gel image, there is a gradient in band intensities across the cycles (band intensity increases as cycle number increases). Looks like we can use 12 cycles for our PCRs.\nOne other aspect of this gel that is very interesting is the ligations. The three ligation samples all show an intact high molecular weight band! This is very surprising, since the input gDNA from these three samples does not look this."

As it turns out, when multiplexed libraries are sequenced using the Illumina platform, an index read step needs to be “enabled” on the machine for sequencing. Otherwise, the machine does not perform the index read step (since it wouldn’t be necessary for a single library). Surprisingly, the sample submission form for the Univ. of Oregon Genomics Core Facility  doesn’t request any information regarding whether or not a submitted sample has been multiplexed. However, by default, they enable the index read step on all sequencing runs.

I will perform a final RNA isolation attempt (the kit only has six columns left) from the following samples:\n\n02\n03\n04\n07\n08\n09\n\nInstead of full sections from each histology cassette, I gouged samples directly from the tissue in each of the blocks to maximize the amount of tissue input.\nIMPORTANT:\n\nUsed Buffer TR1 + β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) prepared 201500505 as well as fresh Buffer TR1 + β-ME prepared today.\nI used aliquots of DNase prepared on 20150408.\n\nSamples were then processed with the PAXgene Tissue RNA Kit in a single group.\nIsolated RNA according to the PAXgene Tissue RNA Kit protocol with the following alterations:\n\n“Max speed” spins were performed at 19,000g.\nTissue disruption was performed with the Disruptor Genie @ 45C for 15mins.\nShaking incubation step was performed with Disruptor Genie\nSamples were eluted with 40μL of Buffer TR4, incubated @ 65C for 5mins, immediately placed on ice and quantified on the Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000.\n\nAll samples were stored @ -80C in Shellfish RNA Box #5.\nResults:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150508_geoduck_histo_RNA_ODs.JPG)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20150508_geoduck_histo_RNA_plots.JPG)\nTwo samples (02 and 07) produced great yields and perfect RNA (260/280 and 260/230 of ~2.0). The remainder of the samples showed little improvement compared to what I’ve been obtaining from the previous three attempts. Will discuss with Steven and Brent about how to proceed with this project."

I’ve emailed BGI about what we should expect from this initial assembly and what subsequent assemblies should look like."

Next, I’ll run PyRad using our Oly partial genome that we have from BGI. This will allow a more descriptive evaluation of SNP loci, since we’ll actually be able to associate the SNPs with various gene annotations, thus providing more meaningful insight.\nOn the Oly genome front, I also need to submit samples for PacBio sequencing. This will be an attempt to fill in the gaps of the Oly genome scaffold we currently have.\nFinally, if all goes well, I’ll get something written up and submitted to Scientific Data."

A fair amount of smearing, but a strong, high molecular weight band is present. The intensity of the smearing is likely due to the fact that the gel is overloaded for this particular well size. If I had used a broader comb and/or loaded less DNA, the band would be more defined and the smearing would be less prominent.\nWill submit sample to the UW PacBio facility tomorrow!"

    "text": "We’re working on a project with Washington Department of Natural Resources’ (DNR) Micah Horwith to identify potential proteomic biomarkers in geoduck (Panopea generosa) and  Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). One aspect of the project is how to best conduct sampling of juvenile geoduck (Panopea generosa) and Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) to minimize changes in the proteome of ctenidia tissue during sampling. Generally, live animals are shucked, tissue dissected, and then the tissue is “snap” frozen. However, Micah’s crew will be collecting animals from wild sites around Puget Sound and, because of the remote locations and the means of collection, will have limited tools and time to perform this type of sampling. Time is a significant component that will have great impact on proteomic status in each individual.\nAs such, Micah and crew wanted to try out a different means of sampling that would help preserve the state of the proteome at the time of collection. Micah and crew have collected some juveniles of both species and “snap” frozen them in the field in a dry ice/ethanol bath in hopes of being able to best preserve the ctenidia proteome status. I’m attempting to dissect out the frozen ctenidia tissue from both types of animals and am reporting on the success/failure of this method of preservation-sampling protocol.\nTo test this, I transferred animals (contained in baggies) from the -80C to dry ice. Utensils and weigh boats were cooled on dry ice.\nResults:\nQuick summary: This method won’t and I think sampling will have to take place in the field.\nThe details of why this won’t work (along with images of the process) are below.\nFirst issue with this sampling method (and should be noted because I believe dry ice/ethanol baths will be used, even with a different sampling methodology) is that the ethanol in the dry ice bath at the time of animal collection is a potential problem for labeling baggies. Notice in the screenshot below that the label for the geoduck baggie (the baggie on the left) has, for all intents and purposes, completely washed off:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/DSC_1234.jpg)\nStarting with C.gigas, opening the animal was relatively easy. Granted, the animal has become brittle, but access to, and identification of, tissues ended up being pretty easy:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/DSC_1235.jpg)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/DSC_1236.jpg)\nHowever, dissecting out just ctenidia is a lost cause. The mantle and the ctendia are, essentially, fused together in a frozen block through the oyster. Although the image below might look like part of the shell, it is not. It is strictly a chunk of frozen ctenidia/mantle tissue:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/DSC_1237.jpg)\nThe geoduck were even more difficult. In fact, I couldn’t even manage to remove the soft tissue from the shell (for the uninitiated, there are two geoduck in the image below). I only managed to crush most of the tissue contained within the shell, making it even more impossible (if that’s possible) to identify and dissect out the ctenidia:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/DSC_1238.jpg)\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/DSC_1239.jpg)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This isn’t really a notebook entry - it’s more of a traditional blog post.\nIt’s a quick summary of the frustrations and struggles I’ve encountered while trying to analyze the Olympia oyster GBS data. Hopefully it will serve as a place holder for others to find (and avoid) some of the pitfalls I’ve encountered so far. But, mostly, this is just for me to vent…\n\nUsing the Stacks program (on Hummingbird over the network to our server Owl) takes forever and, more importantly, consistently fails to complete the ustacks and cstacks programs.\nUsing the Stacks program (on Hummingbird via external HDD connected through Firewire) takes forever (combined, process_radtags and ustacks has been running since 20160428; that’s eight days)!!! Granted, this is running on all 96 samples, but, regardless, this type of time frame is not very conducive to productivity.\nThe “raw” non-demultiplexed fastq files supplied by BGI have a ‘N’ in the barcode in the FASTQ header lines. This prevents Stacks (and possibly Tassel - I’ll get to this in a second) from being able to perform the demultiplexing. Here’s a screen shot of what I’m talking about:\n\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20160503_BGI_GBS_fastq_header_barcode.png)\n\nCyverse has a program called Tassel that should be able to handle GBS data just like ours. However, it doesn’t produce the expected output to proceed to the second step. Although I haven’t tested it, it’s possible that the problem is related to the ‘N’ in the FASTQ header barcode sequence I mentioned above. I suspect it’s related because the first step in using Tassel is demultiplexing utilizing a supplied barcode keyfile.\nCyverse has Stacks installed, but in order to use it, someone has to build a Cyverse “app.” I’ve tried and the process is brutal. It’s not conducive for a program (that is really a suite of programs) like Stacks that has so many command line options and, depending on your input file types (e.g. “non-standard” Illumina filenames for paired-end sequencing), requires looping over filenames to specify corresponding file pairs.\nPyrad actually worked relatively well, but the VCF output file (for visualizing in the Integrative Genomics Viewer) has an ill-formed header that IGV won’t accept. Attempts at tweaking the header don’t seem to resolve the issue. Additionally, it’s not apparent in the output files if individuals get grouped, even though there is an option to specify which individuals should be grouped together.\nAnd, the most frustrating thing of all???!!!  I just realized how to handle the problematic barcodes in the FASTQ headers!! Instead of trying to alter the FASTQ files (which I’ve been messing around with over the past few days), all I’ve needed to do this entire time is CHANGE THE BARCODE KEY FILE THAT STACKS AND/OR TASSEL USES TO HAVE A ‘N’ AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BARCODE!\n\nI’m going to go cry now…\nRegardless of that last one, it doesn’t change the fact that Stacks is painfully slow and, at times, unreliable."

Strong, high molecular weight band is present with minimal smearing. However, there is a smear in the ~500bp range. This is most likely residual RNA. This is surprsing since the E.Z.N.A Mollusc Kit includes n RNase step. Regardless, having intact, high molecular weight DNA is the important part for this project.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We have an enormous backlog of high-throughput sequencing files (641 FASTQ files, to be exact) that we need/want to get added to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA).\nThis post provides a brief summary of what’s involved in the process (mostly via screen shots) and attempts to identify the various pitfalls/pains that I’ve already stumbled through trying to get a set of six FASTQ files submitted properly.\nOVERALL - It’s horrible and tedious.\nImportant things to note:\n\nOnce any of the three required components for SRA submission have been created (SRA, BioProject, and BioSamples), they can no longer be edited/deleted by the user! Understandable if they’ve already been publicly released, but if they’re still in pre-public release status, I think the user should be able to make changes as they see fit. As it currently stands, the user has to email the help desk at SRA and/or BioProjects to make any changes.\nExtremely difficult to figure out which information will show up (and where it will show up) in the final, formatted SRA record - no guide to this that I could find. Thus, if you screw it up, it’s a major, major hassle to try to change anything.\nWhen creating a “Run” (within an “Experiment”, within your SRA submission), only include sequencing files that provide the same data (e.g. if you have multiple sequence files, each generated from different individuals/samples, then you need to create a separate “Experiment” and “Run” for each of those files - otherwise, all files uploaded to a “Run” are combined into a single SRA file that loses any distinguishing info from the separate sequencing files).\nWhen creating a batch submission for BioSamples, there’s no way to set a Title attribute. This means all of your submissions (in my case) will have all have a title of “Invertebrate sample”. Considering that I will likely end up with dozens of BioSamples, that means there’s no easy way to distinguish them from each other without some extra clicking and poking around.\n\nHere’s the best way to proceed:\n\nCreate a BioProject. This will sit at the top of the hierarchy in the SRA submission and will be displayed as the STUDY associated with the SRA.\nCreate BioSample(s). This will be the next level of the hierarchy in the SRA submission and will be displayed as SAMPLE. This only shows up in the SRA when you create a new “Experiment”\nCreate SRA. This will end up encompassing any BioProject(s) and BioSample(s) that you need to include to describe the sequencing files you’re submitting to the SRA.\nCreate an Experiment.\nCreate a Run. This option is available once you’ve saved your experiment. This is where you provide your sequencing filename and associated MD5 checksum. This will also provide you with the login info to upload your sequencing files via FTP to NCBI servers. You can associate multiple sequencing files within a single run. This should be done if your sequencing files all provide data for the BioSample you selected. However, if you have sequencing files that are associated with different BioSamples, then you need to create an individual Experiment (and Run) for each BioSample!\n\nHere are some links that might come in handy (although, none are that great)…\nSRA Getting Started (helpful):\n\nhttps://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?cmd=show&f=sra_sub_expl&view=get_started\n\nSRA Metadata Overview (this is helpful):\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submitmeta/\n\nSRA Submission Quick Start Guide (this is useful!):\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submit/\n\nFTP Upload Instructions:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submitfiles/\n\nUser UN-friendly SRA Guide:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47528/?report=reader\n\nAnd, here are the screen caps, roughly in chronological order of how the process presents itself. It’s too time consuming to caption any of these, so I’m putting them up for a reference. Also, all of the information seen in these screen caps has been deleted (because the entire submission was totally jacked up in multiple facets), so don’t look for any of the various submission IDs - they no longer exist. This is really just to visually show how many steps there are in order to get stuff submitted - it’s brutal."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently moved some computing jobs over to Amazon’s Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) in attempt to avoid some odd computing issues/errors I kept encountering on our lab computers (Apple Xserve 3,1).\nThe big trade off here is that the lab computers are paid for and using EC2 means we’ll be sinking more money into computing resources. With that expense should come faster processing (i.e. less time) to perform various analyses. As they say, time is money…\nLet’s look at how things’ve worked out so far.\nFirst, how much did we spend and how did we spend it (click on the image to enlarge)?\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20160801_AmazonEC2_costs.jpg)\nOf course, it’s easy to see that for the instance I was running, it cost us $0.419/hr. That’s great and all, but you sort of lose sense of what that ends up costing over the long-term. Let’s look at how things break out over a larger time scale.\nAccording to Amazon’s (very useful!) billing breakdown, we spent $187 in the month of July 2016. This doesn’t seem too bad. In fact, this would only cost us ~$2200/yr if we continue to run this instance in this fashion. However, let’s look at it a bit further.\nWe see that the instance ran for a total of 374 hrs during July 2016. Divide that by 24hrs/day and we see that the instance was running for 15.6 days; just over half the month. That means we would’ve spent ~$374 for the full month, which would equate to $4488/yr. For our lab, that kind of money starts to add up and one starts to wonder if it wouldn’t be better to invest in higher end hardware to use in the lab with a single “sunk” cost that will last us many, many years.\nRegardless, with the lab’s current computing hardware, we should compare another factor that’s involved with the expense of using Amazon EC2 instead of our lab computers: time.\nI performed a very rough “guestimation” of the time savings that EC2 has provided us.\nI compared the length of “real” time for the first step in the PyRad program using the same data set on one of our lab computers (roadrunner) and the Amazon EC2 instance:\n\nroadrunner: 1118 minutes\nEC2: 771 minutes\n\nRoadrunner is nearly 1.5x slower than the EC2 instance! To really appreciate what type of impact that has, we should look at the run time for the full PyRad analysis:\n\nroadrunner: 5546 minutes (NOTE: Due to incomplete analysis, roadrunner time is “guestimated” as 1.45 x EC2; see below)\nEC2: 3825 minutes\n\nLet’s convert those numbers into something more easily understood - hours and days:\n\nroadrunner: 95hrs\nroadrunner: ~4 days\nEC2: 63hrs\nEC2: ~2.6 days\n\nOf course, these times don’t take into account any technical issues that we might encounter (and I have encountered many technical issues using roadrunner) on either platform, but I can tell you that I’ve not had any headaches using EC2 (other than unintentional, self-imposed ones).\nAnother potential option is trying out InsideDNA. They offer cloud computing services that are specifically geared towards high-throughput bioinformatics analysis. They have many, many bioinformatics tools already installed and available to use on their platform. Additionally, they have nice tutorials on how to use some of these tools, which goes a long ways in getting started on any analyses using new software. Here are the various pricing tiers that they offer:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20160801_insideDNA_pricing.jpg)\nThe “Advanced” tier ($100/month) certainly seems like it could potentially be better than using Amazon. However, this tier only offers 500GB of storage. If you look up above at the Amazon pricing breakdown, you’ll notice that I’ve already used 466GB of storage for just that one experiment! Additionally, the 1000 CPU hours seems great, but remember, this is likely divided by the number of CPUs that you end up using. The Amazon EC2 instance was running eight cores. If I were to run a similar set up on InsideDNA, that would amount to 125 CPU hours per core. Again, looking up above, we see that I ran the EC2 instance for 374 hours! That means the “Advanced” tier on InsideDNA wouldn’t be enough to get our jobs done.\nAnyway, in the grand scheme of things, using an Amazon EC2 instance periodically as we need it throughout the year isn’t terrible. However, if we start using the University of Washington Hyak computing cluster we may be able to avoid spending on EC2 and be able to have similar time savings (compared to using the lab computers). Need to get cracking on that…"

    "text": "Recently, we’ve been bumping into our storage limit on Eagle (our Synology DS413):\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20160114_eagle_storage.jpg)\nBeing fairly certain that there’s a significant amount of large datasets that is duplicated throughout Eagle, I ran a program on Linux called “fslint”. It searches for duplicates files based on a few parameters and is smart enough to be able to compare files with different filenames that share the same file contents!\nI decided to check for duplicate files in the Eagle/archive folder and the Eagle/web folder. Initially, I tried searching for duplicates across all of Eagle, but after a week of running I got tired of waiting for results and ran the analysis on those two directories independently. As such, there is a possibility that there are more duplicates (consuming even more space) across the remainder of Eagle that have not been identified. However, this is a good starting point.\nHere are the two output files from the fslint analysis:\n\n20160104_duplicate_files_eagle_web.txt\n20151229_duplicate_files_eagle_archive.txt\n\nTo get a summary of the fslint output, I tallied the total amount of duplicates files that were >100MB in size. This was performed in a Jupyter notebook (see below): Notebook Viewer: 20160114_wasted_space_synologies.ipynb Jupyter (IPython) Notebook File: 20160114_wasted_space_synologies.ipynb \nHere are the cleaned output files from the fslint analysis:\n\n20151229_duplicate_files_eagle_archive_cleaned.txt\n20151229_duplicate_files_eagle_web_cleaned.txt\n\nSummary\nThere are duplicates of files (>100MB in size) that are consuming at least 730GB!\nSince the majority of these files exist in the Eagle/web folder, careful consideration will have to be taken in determining which duplicates (if any) can be deleted since it’s highly possible that there are notebooks that link to some of the files. Regardless, this analysis shows just how space is being consumed by the presence of large, duplicate files; something to consider for future data handling/storage/analysis with Eagle."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In an attempt at furthering our lab’s abilities to maximize our reproducibility, I’ve been  working on developing an all-encompassing Docker image. Docker is a type of virtual machine (i.e. a self-contained computer that runs within your computer). For the Roberts Lab, the advantage of using Docker is that the Docker images can be customized to run a specific suite of software and these images can then be used by any other person in the lab (assuming they can run Docker on their particular operating system), regardless of operating system. In turn, if everyone is using the same Docker image (i.e. the same virtual machine with all the same software), then we should be able to reproduce data analyses more reliably, due to the fact that there won’t be differences between software versions that people are using. Additionally, using Docker greatly simplifies the setup of new computers with the requisite software.\nI’ve put together a Dockerfile (a Dockerfile is a text file/script that Docker uses to retrieve software and build a computer image with those specific instructions) which will automatically build a Docker image (i.e. virtual computer) that contains all of the normal bioinformatics software our lab uses. This has been a side project while I wait for Stacks analysis to complete (or, fail, depending on the day) and it’s finally usable! The image that is built from this Dockerfile will even let the user run R Studio and/or Jupyter Notebooks in their browser (I’m excited about this part)!\nHere’s the current list of software that will be installed:\n\n\n\n\n\nbedtools 2.25.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbismark 0.15.0\n\n\n\n\nblast 2.3.0+\n\n\n\n\nbowtie2 2.2.8\n\n\n\n\nbsmap 2.90\n\n\n\n\ncufflinks 2.1.1\n\n\n\n\nfastqc 0.11.5\n\n\n\n\nfastx_toolkit 0.0.13\n\n\n\n\nR 3.2.5\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Server0.99\n\n\n\n\npyrad 3.0.66\n\n\n\n\nsamtools 0.1.19\n\n\n\n\nstacks 1.40\n\n\n\n\ntophat 2.1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrimmomatic 0.36\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to set this up, you need to install Docker and download the Dockerfile (Dockerfile.bio) I’ve created.\nI’ve written a bit of a user guide (specific to this Dockerfile) here to get people started: docker.md\nThe user guide explains a bit how all of this works and tries to progress from a “basic” this-is-how-to-get-started-with-Docker to an “advanced” description of how to map ports, mount local volumes in your containers, and how to start/attach previously used containers.\nThe next major goal I have with this Docker project is to get the R kernel installed for Jupyter Notebooks. Currently, the Jupyter Notebook installation is restricted to the default Python 2 kernel.\nAdditionally, I’d like to improve the usability of the Docker image by setting up aliases in the image. Meaning, a user who wants to use the bowtie program can just type “bowtie”. Currently, the user has to type “bowtie2_2.2.8” (although, with this being in the system PATH and tab-completion, it’s not that big of a deal), which is a bit ugly.\nFor some next level stuff, I’d also like to setup all Roberts Lab computers to automatically launch the Docker image when the user opens a terminal. This would greatly simplify things for new lab members. They wouldn’t have to deal with going through the various Docker commands to start a Docker container. Instead, their terminal would just put them directly into the container and the user would be none-the-wiser. They’d be reproducibly conducting data analysis without even having to think about it."

I have another Jupyter notebook running on a different computer that will separate the three populations that are present in this subset.\nOverall, I don’t fully understand the results. However, this seems to be the quickest assessment of the data (from the *.snps file generated):\n28 individuals, 36424 loci, 72251 snps\nAdditionally, I did run into an issue when I tried to visualize the data (using the *.vcf file generated) in IGV (see screen cap below).

Copying took hours; left lab before copying completed.\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20160714_s3f2_mount_error.jpg)\nSo, that didn’t work. The reason that it doesn’t work is that I uploaded the files to the S3 bucket via the Amazon AWS command line (awscli). Apparently, s3fs-fuse can’t mount S3 buckets that contain data uploaded via awscli [see this GitHub Issue for s3fs-fuse! However, I had to upload them via awscli because the web interface kept failing!\nThat means I need to upload the data directly to my EC2 instance, but my EC2 instance is set with the default storage capacity of 8GB so I need to increase the capacity to accommodate my two large files, as well as the anticipated intermediate files that will be generated by the types of analysis I plan on running. I’m guessing I’ll need at least 100GB to be safe. To do this, I have to expand the Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume of my instance. The rest of stuff below is fully explained and covered very well in the EBS expansion link I have in the previous sentence.\nDon’t be fooled into thinking I figured any of this out on my own!\nExpanding the EC2 Instance\nThe initial part of the process is creating a Snapshot of my instance. This took a long time (2.5hrs). However, I did finally decide to refresh the page when I noticed that the “Status” progress bar hadn’t moved beyond 46% for well over an hour. After refreshing, the “Status” showed “Complete.” Maybe this actually was ready to go much faster, but the page didn’t automatically refresh? Regardless, in retrospect, since this EC2 instance is pretty much brand new and doesn’t have too many changes from when it was initialized, I probably should’ve just created a brand new EC2 instance with the desired amount of EBS…\nCreated volume from that Snapshot with 150GB of magnetic storage.\nAttached volume to the EC2 instance at /dev/sda1 (the default setting /dev/sdf resulted in an error message about the instance not having a root volume) and SSH’d into the instance. Odd, it seems to show that I still only have 8GB of storage (see the “Usage of…” in the screenshot below):\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20160714_ec2_expanded_volume_01.png)\nCheck to see if I actually have the expanded storage volume or not. It turns out, I do! (notice that the only drive listed is “xvda” and its partition, “xvda/xvda1” AND they are equal in size; 150G):\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20160714_ec2_expanded_volume_03.jpg)\nTime to upload (via the secure copy command) the files to my EC2 instance! The following commands upload the files to a folder called “data” in my /home directory. I also ran the “time” command at the beginning to get an idea of how long it takes to upload each of these files.\n<code>time scp -i ~/Dropbox/Lab/Sam/bioinformatics.pem /Volumes/web/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_1.fq.gz ubuntu@ec2.ip.address:~/data</code>\n\n\n\n\n\n<code>time scp -i ~/Dropbox/Lab/Sam/bioinformatics.pem /Volumes/web/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_2.fq.gz ubuntu@ec2.ip.address:~/data</code>\nDetails on upload times and file sizes:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20160714_ec2_upload_times.png)\nConfim the files now reside in my EC2 instance:\n(http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/20160714_ec2_confirm_transfer.jpg)\nAlas, I should’ve captured all of this in a Jupyter Notebook. However, I didn’t because I thought I would need to enter passwords (which you can’t do with a Jupyter Notebook). It turns out, I didn’t need a password for anything; even when using “sudo” on the EC2 instance. Oh well, it’s set up and running with my data finally accessible. That’s all that really matters here.\nAlrighty, time to get rolling on some data analysis with a fancy new Amazon EC2 instance!!!"

Instead, it’s a “friendly” lab competition to get some scientific publications assembled and submitted.\nAnother goal for this month is to get the -80C organized. We’ve made some major progress on lab organization, with major kudos going to Grace Crandall and her work on cleaning out fridges/freezers and putting together our lab inventory spreadsheet. The -80C organization is the final frontier of getting the lab fully under control and more well-regulated.\nContinuing on the organization front, it’d be great if we could get the Data Management Plan finished. Sean Bennett has helped get us much closer to completion. Hopefully this month we can get it finalized and have it be fully functional so that any lab member can easily figure out what to do when they receive new sequencing data.\nI’d also like to put together a more automated means of handling our high-throughput sequencing data when we receive it. Ideally, it’d be a Jupyter Notebook and all the user would have to do is enter the desired location (heck, maybe I could even simplify it further by requiring just a species name…) for the files to be stored and then press “play” on the notebook. The files would go through a post-download integrity check, moved to final location, re-check integrity, update checksum files, and update readme files. I have most of the bits here and there in various Jupyter Notebooks already, but haven’t taken the time to put them all together into a single, reusable notebook."

the familiar FASTQ file (filtered_subreads.fastq), which is what will likely be used for downstream analysis, but it’s hard to make a decision on how we manage this data under the guidelines of our current DMP. It’s possible we might separate data files from the numerous other files (the other files are, essentially, metadata), but we need to decide which file type(s) (e.g. .h5 files, .fastq files) will server as the data files people will rely on for analysis. So, for the time being, this will be how the data is stored.\nI’ll update the readme file to reflect the addition of the top level folders (e.g. ../20170323_pacbio/170210_PCB-CC_MS_EEE_20kb_P6v2_D01_1/).\nI’ll also update the GitHub Wiki"

    "text": "Previously, I used the following three tools to do quick assembly of our Olympia oyster PacBio data:\n\nminimap\nminiasm\nracon\n\nI’m just posting this quick overview to make it easier to follow what was actually done without having to read through three different notebook entries and corresponding Jupyter notebooks.\nWhen I say “quick assembly”, I mean it. The entire assembly process probably takes about an hour on the computer I used - that seems fast.\nHere’s the quick and dirty of what was done:\n\n1 Run minimap:\nThis uses a pre-built set of defaults (the ava-pb in the code below) for analyzing PacBio data. Minimap only accepts two FASTQ files and you need to map your FASTQ file against itself. So, if you have multiple FASTQ sequencing files, you have to concatenate them into a single file prior to running minimap.\n<code>minimap2 -x ava-pb -t 23 \\\n20170911_oly_pacbio_cat.fastq \\\n20170911_oly_pacbio_cat.fastq \\\n> 20170911_minimap2_pacbio_oly.paf</code>\n\n\n2 Run miniasm:\nThis uses your concatenated FASTQ file and the PAF file output from the miniasm step. The code below is taken from the example provided in the miniasm documentation; there are other options available.\n<code>miniasm \\\n-f \\\n/home/data/20170911_oly_pacbio_cat.fastq /home/data/20170911_minimap2_pacbio_oly.paf > /home/data/20170918_oly_pacbio_miniasm_reads.gfa</code>\n\n\n3 Convert miniasm output GFA to FASTA\nThe FASTA file is needed to re-run minimap in Step 4 below.\n<code>awk '$1 ~/S/ {print \">\"$2\"\\n\"$3}' 20170918_oly_pacbio_miniasm_reads.gfa > 20170918_oly_pacbio_miniasm_reads.fasta</code>\n\n\n4 Run minimap with default settings\nUsing the default settings maps the FASTQ reads back to the contigs (the PAF file) created in the fist step. These mappings are required for Racon assembly (Step 5).\n<code>minimap2 \\\n-t 23 \\\n20170918_oly_pacbio_miniasm_reads.fasta 20170905_minimap2_pacibio_oly.paf > 20170918_minimap2_mapping_fasta_oly_pacbio.paf</code>\n\n\n5 Run racon\nThe output file is the FASTA file listed below.\n<code>racon -t 24 \\\n20170911_oly_pacbio_cat.fastq \\\n20170918_oly_pacbio_minimap_mappings.paf \\\n20170918_oly_pacbio_miniasm_assembly.gfa \\\n20170918_oly_pacbio_racon1_consensus.fasta</code>"

I improved the instructions on the DMP a bit, but the master spreadsheet on which the DMP revolves around (Nightingales) is still in a massive state of flux that needs a lot of attention.\nSequencing data handling - Thanks to Sean for putting forth a serious dent in automating this. He wrote an R script to handle this sort of thing. I’m not entirely sure if he’s done testing it, but it seems to work so far. Next will be incorporating usage instructions of this R script into the DMP so that others can utilize it.

This makes ID-ing the proper tissues tedious and, at times, difficult.\nThe list of tissues that needs to be processed is listed in this GitHub Issue #648.

These numbers were chosen based off of the sample with the lowest concentration.\nThe following samples were used in their entirety:\n\n2h Block 8\nD35 Block 8\n\nCalculations were added to the spreadsheet provided by Javier (Google Sheet): A.cervicornis_DNA_Extractions(May_2017).xlsx\nThe spreadsheet became overly complicated because I initially forgot to account for the need to run each sample in duplicate.\nThe kit reagent dilutions were as follows:\n\nDiluted ME1: 52mL of ME1 + 464mL of distilled water\nDiluted ME4: 10uL of ME4 + 10uL of TE Buffer (pH=8.0; made by me on 20130408).\nStandard curve: Prepped per instruction manual, with double volumes for two plates.\nDiluted ME5: 50uL/well x 152well = 7600uL; 7600uL/1000 = 7.6uL; 7.6uL ME5 + 7592.4uL Diluted ME1\nDiluted ME6: 50uL/well x 152well = 7600uL; 7600uL/2000 = 3.8uL; 3.8uL ME6 + 7596.2uL Diluted ME1\nDiluted ME7: 50uL/well x 152well = 7600uL; 7600uL/5000 = 1.52uL; 1.52uL ME7 + 7598.48uL Diluted ME1\n\nAll diluted solutions were stored on ice for duration of procedure.\nThe remaining Diluted ME1 solution was stored at 4C (FTR 209), and is stable for 6 months, per the manufacturer’s instructions.\nSee the Results section below for plate layouts.\nPlates were read at 450nm on the Seeb Lab Victor 1420 Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer) and the amount of DNA methylation was determined.\nResults:\nIndividual sample methylation quantification (Google Sheet): A.cervicornis_DNA_Extractions(May_2017).xlsx\nPlate Reader Output File Plate #1 (Google Sheet): 20170511_coral_DNA_methylation_plate01.xls\nPlate Reader Output File Plate #2 (Google Sheet): 20170511_coral_DNA_methylation_plate02.xls\nI’m not familiar with the experimental design, so I’m not going to spend time handling any of the in-depth analysis at this point in time. However, here’s the background on how methylation quantification and percent methylation were determined.\n\nMean absorbance (450nm) was determined for all samples and standard curve samples. It’s important to note that the standard deviation between replicates was not evaluated and there appears to be consistent variability between samples, but I’m not certain how much variation is “acceptable” with and assay of this nature.\nThe mean absorbance of the standard curve samples were plotted against their corresponding DNA amounts and a linear trendline was fitted to the points.\nPer the manufacturer’s recommendations, the four points (including the zero point) that yielded the best linear fit (i.e. best R^2 value) were used and the slope of best fit line for those four points was determined.\nThis slope was then utilized in the equation provided by the manufacturer (see pg. 8 of the MethylFlash Kit manual)."

Since we don’t have the broad range RNA assay, I can’t properly quantify the remaining samples. However, these samples are being sent to Katherine Silliman at some point, so I’ll leave it up to her to quantify the samples. I’m also guessing that she’ll run them on a Bioanalyzer to assess their integrity prior to beginning library construction, so that will also yield concentrations for the samples.\nSamples were stored at -80C temporarily.\nSamples will be sent to Katherine Silliman for high-throughput library construction and sequencing once I hear back from her regarding her availability to receive the samples."

The headers (represented by a series of ‘#’) require a space between them and the subsequent text.  I used the following command in bash:\nfor i in *.md; do sed -i.bak 's/^#*/& /g' \"$i\"; done\nThe code works as follows:\n\nRun for loop on all .md files in the directory\nUse sed to edit the files in place: -i.bak (this command structure is needed for Mac OS X).\n's/^#*/&amp; /g': Performs a substitution by identifying all lines beginning (^) with a pound symbol (#) and match zero or more occurrences of the pound symbol (*), then substituting the same pattern that was matched and adding a space at the end of the pattern (& ).

This will confirm two things: 1 - The data did not get corrupted when copied. 2 - The new filenames correspond to the correct, original filtered_subreads.fastq.gz file (renaming a file doesn’t alter the MD5 checksum).\nArchive the original SMRT cell run folders (which contain a ton of metdata files)"

During sampling, it was difficult to get a lot of what we considered “pure” gonadal tissue. We sent you ~1/2 of the amount of tissue we have for all samples except for the two samples which were very low and we sent you all the tissue sample we have.

    "text": "Since we’re preparing a manuscript that relies on BGI’s manipulation/handling of the genotype-by-sequencing data, I attempted to could reproduce the demultiplexing steps that BGI used in order to perform the SNP/genotyping on these samples.\nThe key word in the above sentence is “attempted.” Ugh, what a massive waste of time it turned out to be. I’ve contacted BGI to get some help on this.\nIn the meantime, here’s a brief (actually, not as brief as I’d like) rundown of my struggles.\nThe demultiplexing software that BGI used is something called “iTools” which is bundled in this GitHub repo: Resqtools\nTo demutliplex, they ran a script called: split.sh\nThe script seems fairly straightforward. Here is what it contains:\n<code>iTools Fqtools splitpool \\\n-InFq1 160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_1.fq.gz \\\n-InFq2 160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_2.fq.gz \\\n-Index index.lst \\\n-Flag enzyme.txt \\\n-MisMatch \\\n-OutDir split\n</code>\nIt tells the iTools program to use the Fqtools tool “splitpool” to operate on a pair of gzipped FASTQ files. It also utilizes an index file (index.lst) which contains all the barcodes needed to identify, and separate, the individual samples that were combined prior to sequencing.\nThe first bump in the road is the -Flag enzyme.txt portion of the code. BGI did not provide me with this file. I recently requested them to send me it (or its contents, since I suspected it was only a single line text file). They sent me the contents of the file:\n<code>CAGC\nCTGC</code>\nThe next problem is neither of those two sequences are the recognition site for the enzyme that was (supposedly) used: ApeKI. The recognition site for ApeKI is: GCWGC\nRegardless, I decided to see if I could reproduce the demultiplexing using the info they’d provided me.\nI cloned the Resqtools repo, changed into the Reseqtools/iTools directory and typed make.\nThis resulted in an error informing me that it could not find boost/spirit/core.hpp\nI tracked down the Boost library junk, downloaded the newest version and untarred it in /usr/local/bin.\nTried to run make in the Reseqtools/iTools directory and got the same error. Realized iTools might not be searching the system $PATH (this turned out to be correct), so I moved the contents of the Boost folder to the iTools, ran make and got the same error. Turns out, the newest version of Boost doesn’t have that core.hpp file any more. Looking at the iTools documentation, iTools was built around Boost 1.44. OMG…\nDownloaded Boost 1.44 and went through the same steps as above. This eliminated the missing core.hpp error!\nBut, of course, led to another error. The error:\n<code>\"Threading support unavaliable: it has been explicitly disabled with BOOST_DISABLE_THREADS\"</code>\nThat was related to something with newer versions of the GCC compiler (this is, essentially, built into the computer; it’s not worth trying to install/use old versions of GCC) trying to work with old versions of Boost. Found a patch for a config file here: libstdcpp3.hpp.patch\nI made the appropriate edits to the file as shown in that link and ran make and it almost worked!\nThe current error is:\n<code>./src/Variants/soapsv-v1.02/include.h:15:16: fatal error: gd.h: No such file or directory</code>\nI gave up and contacted BGI to see if they can get me a functional version of iTools…"

Granted, it took over 16hrs (!!), but it completed!\nSee the Jupyter notebook link below.\nResults:\nWell, although the script finished and kicked out all the demultiplexed FASTQ files, the contents of the FASTQ files don’t match (the read counts differ between these results and the BGI files) the original set of demultiplexed files. I’m not entirely sure if this is to be expected or not, since the script allows for a single nucleotide mismatch when demultiplexing. Is it possible that the mismatch could be interpreted slightly differently each time this is run? I’m not certain.\nTheoretically, you should get the same results every time…\nMaybe I’ll re-run this again over the weekend and see how the results compare to this run and the original BGI demultiplexing…\nJupyter notebook (GitHub): 20170314_docker_Oly_BGI_GBS_demultiplexing_reproducibility.ipynb\nJupyter notebook (may be easier to view in GitHub link above):"

Check it out! https://t.co/ByKUCpAoIf pic.twitter.com/KulviJhmMh\n— Darrin Schultz (@conchoecia) October 18, 2017\n\n\nAdditionally, I was excited by the “…super easy to use.” part in the description. As it turns out, that part of the Tweet is totally untrue. Here are some of the things that make it difficult to use:\n\nNo pre-install readme file. Without readme file there are no instructions/info on:\n\nNecessary dependencies\nInstall command(s)\n\nInitial install attempt failed with error message. Message suggests trying:\n\nBOOST_ROOT=install ./install.sh\n\nNo post-install readme file. How do I even get started without any documentation??!!\n\nI managed to track down the guide for this, but didn’t get it via searching the internet. I noticed that the link for the software in the original Tweet had a parent directory, so I navigated there and spotted this:\nQuick start guide (PDF): ftp://ftp.genome.umd.edu/pub/MaSuRCA/MaSuRCA_QuickStartGuide.pdf\nAlthough not a big deal, this quick start guide is for the previous version (v.3.2.2).\nSo, is this where we get to the “super easy to use” part? Uh, no. Check it out:\n\nModify a config file (luckily, a template is created during install)\n\n* Illumina paired-end (PE) reads: Aribtrary two letter prefix, mean read length, and read length standard deviation need to be supplied (!!!)\n\n\n* Illumina mate-paired (MP) reads: Called \"JUMP\" in config file and needs the same type of info supplied as PE reads.\n\n\n* PacBio reads: Need to be in a single FASTA file (ugh)!\n\n\n* A bunch of other stuff that I can probably leave alone.\n\nRun the masurca script (located here: MaSuRCA-3.2.3/bin/masurca). This will generate a new script (called assemble.sh).\nRun the assemble.sh script that was created in the previous step.\n\nAlthough not specifically related to the MaSuRCA install, I did encounter problems trying to install this on our Mox (hyak) computing node.\n\nBuild node fail (ironically, this is the specific type of node that’s supposed to be used for compiling software):\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171019_mox_build_masurca_fail.png)\nOK, so I decided to try compiling it using the login node (which is not what the login node is supposed to be used for):\n\n\nLogin node fail:\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171019_mox_login_masurca_fail.png)\nI really didn’t want to have to put together an SBATCH script just to compile this software (which compiled without issue, except for that initial BOOST error thingy, on my local Ubuntu 16.04 LTS system), so I just tried running an interactive node and it worked!\nNow, on to trying to actually run this thing…"

    "text": "— UPDATE 20171009 —\nHaving run through this a bunch of times now, I realized that the analysis below incorrectly identifies the outputs from Sean’s Redundans runs. The correct output from each of those runs should be the “scaffolds.reduced.fa” FAST files. The “contigs.fa” files that I linked to below are actually the assemblies produced by other programs; which are required as an input for Redudans.\n\nI recently completed an assembly of the UW PacBio sequencing data using Racon and wanted some assembly stats, as well as a way to compare this assembly to the assemblies Sean had completed.\nAdditionally, Steven recently performed an assembly comparison and I noticed he got some odd results. Specifically, of the three assemblies he compared (PacBio x 1, Illumina x 2), both of the Illumina assemblies had a large quantity of “Ns” in the assemblies. This didn’t seem right and the comparison program he used (QUAST) spit out a message indicating that it seemed like scaffolds were used, instead of contigs. So, I thought I’d give it a shot and see if I could track down non-scaffolded assemblies produced by Sean.\nJupyter notebook (GitHub): 20171003_docker_oly_assembly_comparisons.ipynb\nFirst, I compared the following six assemblies (FASTA files) using QUAST:\nSean’s Assemblies:\n\nPacBio (Canu): https://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/Sean/Oly_Canu_Output/oly_pacbio_.contigs.fasta\nIllumina (Platanus): https://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/Sean/Oly_Illumina_Platanus_Assembly/Oly_Out__contig.fa\nIllumina (Platanus): https://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/Sean/Oly_Platanus_Assembly_Kmer-22/Oly_Out__contig.fa\nIllumina/PacBio (Redundans): https://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/Sean/Oly_Redundans_Output/contigs.fa\nIllumina/PacBio (Redundans): https://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/Sean/Oly_Redundans_Output_Try_2/contigs.fa\n\nSam’s Assembly:\n\nPacBio (Racon): https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/201709_oly_pacbio_assembly_minimap_asm_racon/20170918_oly_pacbio_racon1_consensus.fasta\n\nQUAST output directory: https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171003_quast_oly_genome_assemblies/\nHere’s the assembly comparison of all assemblies (click on image for larger view):\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171003_oly_assemblies_00.png)\nInteractive version of that graphic is here: https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171003_quast_oly_genome_assemblies/report.html\nThe first thing that jumps out to me is the fact that two of the Illumina assemblies, which used different assemblers(!!) have the EXACT same assembly stats. This occurrence seems extremely unlikely. I’ve double-checked my Jupyter notebook to make sure that I didn’t assign the same file by accident (see Input #6)\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171003_oly_assemblies_01.png)\nVery strange!\nI also noticed that the first Redundans assembly of Sean’s has a ton of “Ns”, suggesting that it’s actually a scaffolded assembly. As with Steven’s QUAST run, QUAST spits out the messages suggesting to use the “–scaffold” option for this file.\nThe other thing I noticed is the two PacBio assemblies (Canu & Racon) have a huge difference in the total number of bp (~13,000,000)! I ran a QUAST assembly comparison between just those two for easier viewing/comparison (https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171003_quast_oly_pacbio_assemblies/):\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171003_oly_assemblies_03.png)\nInteractive version of that graphic is here: https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171003_quast_oly_pacbio_assemblies/report.html\nThe fact that there is such a large discrepancy in the total number of bps between these two assemblies really leaves me to believe that I am missing a FASTQ file from my assembly. I’m going to go back and see if that is indeed the case or if this difference in the assemblies is real.\nHere’s an embedded version of my Jupyter notebook:"

The reason for this is that the adaptor and barcode sequences are still present on all the reads. This will lead to over-representation of these sequences in all of the samples, which, in turn, will skew FastQC’s intepretation of the read qualities. For comparison, I’ll run FastQC on the demultiplexed data provided by BGI and see what the FastQC report looks like on trimmed data.\nHowever, I’ll need to discuss with Steven about whether or not providing the FastQC analysis is worthwhile as part of the “technical validation” aspect of the manuscript. I guess it can’t hurt to provide it, but I’m not entirely sure that the FastQC report provides any real information regarding the quality of the sequencing reads that we received…\nJupyter notebook (GitHub): 20170301_docker_fastqc_nondemultiplexed_bgi_oly_gbs.ipynb"

The problem lies in loss of connection to Owl during the operation. This connection issue was recently noticed by Sean in his dealings with Hyak (mox). According to Sean, the Hyak (mox) people or UW IT ran some tests of their own on this connection and their results suggested that the connection issue is related to a network problem in FTR, and is not related to Owl itself.

    "text": "We received three Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi)hemolymph samples from Pam Jensen (NOAA) yesterday. From her email to Steven:\n\nHi Steven, I am sending: tube #1 crab 3859/3656: 300 ul blood + 1300 ul RNAlater​\ntube #2 crab 3665/3873: 300 ul blood + 1300 ul RNAlater ​tube #3 crab 3665/3873: 200 ul blood + 1400 ul RNAlater​\nThe tubes hold max of 1600 ul. Will know on Sun or Mon if either crab is infected w Hematodinium.\nTracking info to follow. Pam\n\nSamples were stored at 4C O/N.\nHere’s what the samples looked like before processing:\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171107_RNA_isoaltion_crab_01.jpg)\nThe samples are extremely cloudy. I’m not sure if this is expected.\nProcessed samples using RNAzol RT (MRC) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for Total RNA Isolation.\nPelleted samples at 5000g for 5 mins and the samples looked like this:\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171107_RNA_isoaltion_crab_02.jpg)\nDecided to pellet samples for an additional 10mins. The pellet was more compact. Transferred supernatant to clean tube, since it seemed to contain “debris” (maybe cells?). Processed pellet with RNAzol RT. Brief rundown of procedure (all steps at room temp):\n\nTransferred supe to clean tube.\nAdded 1mL RNAzol RT to pellet and mixed by repeated pipetting (solution was cloudy and slightly viscous).\nAdded 400uL of 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O and mixed vigorously by hand.\nIncubated for 10mins.\nCentrifuged 12,000g for 15mins.\n\nSamples looked like this:\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171107_RNA_isoaltion_crab_03.jpg)\n\nThis is not normal. Usually the supernatant is the clear portion, while the blue layer is below that.\n\nTransferred 750uL of the clear portion to clean 1.7mL tube.\nAdded equal volume of isopropanol, mixed by inversion. Appeared to be a very high amount of genomic DNA precipitation visible in the tube.\nIncubated for 10mins.\nCentrifuged 12,000g, 15mins.\n\nSamples looked like this:\n(http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20171107_RNA_isoaltion_crab_04.jpg)\n\n\nIt appears that the nucleotides (the white interphase) are suspended on a “cushion” of higher density solution, instead of pelleted at the bottom of the tube.\n\nRemoved/discarded higher density solution, leaving the white layer on the bottom of the tube.\nCentrifuged 12,000g, 15mins.\nDiscarded supe.\nWashed pellet with 75% ethanol.\nCentrifuged 8,000g, 3mins.\nRepeated Steps 12, 13, & 14, 1x.\nDiscarded ethanol.\nResuspended RNA in 50uL 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O. Pellets did not solubilize on their own. I dispersed the pellets by repeated pipetting (P200). Remaining insoluble material was pelleted (12,000g, 30s) and supernatant was transferred to a new 1.6mL tube.\n\nRNA was quantified using the Qubit 3.0 and the Qubit HS RNA Assay. Used 5uL of each sample.\nResults:\n20171107_qubit_tanner_crab_hemo (Google Sheet)\n\n\nSample ID Conc. (ng/uL) Total Yield (ng)\n\n\n\n\n\n3859/3656\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n3665/3873\n\n\n1.66\n\n\n83\n\n\n\n\n3665/3873\n\n\n2.04\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, both samples from the same crab had similar/decent yields.\nSamples were labeled and stored at -80C in Shellfish RNA Box #6"

    "section": "",
    "text": "After I finally resolved the installation of PB Jelly on Emu (running Ubuntu 16.04), I’ve had a PB Jelly assembly running for the past two weeks! I’ve gotten tired of checking on its status (i.e. is it still running?) every day, so I dove in and figured out how to set up Emu to email me when the job is complete!\nTo get this going, I mainly followed this msmtp ArchWiki guide., but here are the specifics of how I set it up.\n\nStep 1. Installed a mail server:\nsudo apt-get install sendmail\n\n\nStep 2. Installed msmtp:\nsudo apt-get install msmtp\n\n\nStep 3. Created the following file in my home directory (/home/sam/): ~/.msmtprc\nThe original contents of the file for testing were:\n\n       # Example for a user configuration file ~/.msmtprc\n       #\n       # This file focuses on TLS and authentication. Features not used here include\n       # logging, timeouts, SOCKS proxies, TLS parameters, Delivery Status Notification\n       # (DSN) settings, and more.\n\n       # Set default values for all following accounts.\n       defaults\n\n       # Use the mail submission port 587 instead of the SMTP port 25.\n       port 587\n\n       # Always use STARTTLS.\n       tls on\n       tls_starttls on\n       tls_certcheck off\n       # A freemail service\n       account uw\n\n       # Host name of the SMTP server\n       host smtp.washington.edu\n\n       # Envelope-from address\n       from emu@uw.edu\n\n       # Authentication. The password is given using one of five methods, see below.\n       auth on\n       user samwhite\n\n       # Password method 3: Store the password directly in this file. Usually it is not\n       # a good idea to store passwords in plain text files. If you do it anyway, at\n       # least make sure that this file can only be read by yourself.\n       password myuwpassword\n\n       account default : uw\n\nThis is a configuration to allow emails to get sent via the Univ. of Washington email servers. Yes, I currently had UW password saved in this file, but will be addressing this issue below.\n\n\nStep 4. Changed permissions on ~/.msmtprc to be readable/writable only by me (important, particularly if you’ve stored your password in this file!):\nchmod 600 ~/.msmtprc\n\n\nStep 5. Assigned sendmail to use msmtp with the set command (this sets the following command as a positional parameter by adding to the /etc/mail.rc file:\necho “set sendmail=/usr/bin/msmtp” | sudo tee -a /etc/mail.rc\nThis command pipers the output of echo to sudo and uses tee -a to append to our desired file (/etc/mail.rc).\n\n\nStep 5. Send a test email:\necho “Job complete!” | msmtp myuwemail@uw.edu\nThat will send an email with no subject and the body of the email will contain “Job complete!”.\nThat’s the basic set up for this.\nTo use it in your workflow, you’d append that command to the end of any Bash command or in a separate Jupyter notebook cell that is queued to run after a previous cell completes it’s job.\nExample:\necho “This counts as a command”; echo “Job complete!” | msmtp myuwemail@uw.edu\nThis will run the first echo command. When that finishes, then the email command will run. You can get fancy and have different emails in response to how the running program exits (i.e. fails or is successful) and send different email responses, but I’m not going to get into that.\nAnyway, not bad! However, we want to make this a bit nicer and more secure.\n\n\n\nImprove security:\n\nStep 1. Generate a GPG Key:\nFollow the instructions under the Creating an Encryption Key section at this link.\nDO NOT CREATE A PASSWORD! JUST HIT ENTER WHEN AT THAT STEP.\nTechnically, this is does not follow proper security protocols, but this is better than having a plain text password, and setting it up this way is the only way the mail program will send without prompting the user for a password (which kills the automation we’re trying to achieve).\n\n\nStep 2. Create an encrypted password file:\ngpg –encrypt -o ~/.msmtp-password.gpg -r youremailaddress -\nAfter entering that, type your UW email password(NOTE: You will not receive a new prompt, so just type it in), and then Enter. Then, press Ctrl-d.\n\n\nStep 3. Add the following line to your ~/.msmtprc file:\npasswordeval “gpg –quiet –for-your-eyes-only –no-tty –decrypt ~/.msmtp-password.gpg”\nHere’s what the file looks like now:\n\n       # Example for a user configuration file ~/.msmtprc\n       #\n       # This file focuses on TLS and authentication. Features not used here include\n       # logging, timeouts, SOCKS proxies, TLS parameters, Delivery Status Notification\n       # (DSN) settings, and more.\n\n       # Set default values for all following accounts.\n       defaults\n\n       # Use the mail submission port 587 instead of the SMTP port 25.\n       port 587\n\n       # Always use STARTTLS.\n       tls on\n       tls_starttls on\n       tls_certcheck off\n\n       # Email account nickname\n       account uw\n\n       # Host name of the SMTP server\n       host smtp.washington.edu\n\n       # Envelope-from address\n       from emu@uw.edu\n\n       # Authentication. The password is given using one of five methods, see below.\n       auth on\n       user samwhite\n\n\n       # Password method 2: Store the password in an encrypted file, and tell msmtp\n       # which command to use to decrypt it. This is usually used with GnuPG, as in\n       # this example. Usually gpg-agent will ask once for the decryption password.\n       passwordeval    \"gpg --quiet --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty --decrypt ~/.msmtp-password.gpg\"\n\n       account default : uw\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Change permissions on ~/.msmtp-password.gpg so it’s only readable/writable by you:\nchmod 600 ~/.msmtp-password.gpg\n\n\nStep 5. Send a test email like before:\necho “Job complete!” | msmtp myuwemail@uw.edu\nThat’s it for security.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a subject to the emails:\n\nStep 1. Create ~/.default_subject.mail and add the following lines to the file (substitute your own email address):\n\nTo: myuwemail@uw.edu\nFrom: [EMU]\nSubject: JOB COMPLETE!\n\n\nFeel free to change the Subject and/or From info to whatever you’d like.\n\n\nStep 2. Send message using ~/.default_subject.mail:\ncat ~/.default_subject.mail | msmtp myuwemail@uw.edu\nTo use this in your workflow, you’ll do just like before (but using the command immediately above) and append to the end of any Bash command.\n\n\n\n\nMake it short & sweet\nAppending those lines is going to be difficult to remember, is annoying to type out, and displays your email address (particularly if using a publicly hosted Jupyter notebook like most of us in lab do). Here’s a nice way to remedy that.\n\nStep 1. Add email address as variable in ~/.bashrc:\nAdd the following lines to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:\n\n# Email address\nexport EMAIL=myuwemail@uw.edu\n\nYour email address is now saved in the variable $EMAIL. You will need to use the following command to load that information:\nsource ~/.bashrc\nVerify that it worked:\necho “$EMAIL”\nThat should spit out your email address and is ready to be used!\n\n\nStep 2. Add alias for full mail command to ~/.bash_aliases file:\necho “alias emailme=‘cat ~/.default_subject.mail | msmtp “$EMAIL”’” >> ~/.bash_aliases\nVerify that it worked:\nsource ~/.bash_aliases\nemailme\nSo, from now on, all you have to do is append the command emailme to the end of any Bash commands and you’ll get email when the job is finished!!! You can edit Steps 1 & 2 to use a variable other than “EMAIL” and an alias other than “emailme” - use whatever you’d like."

Compared to the example on Pg. 12 in the manual, these libraries all have some extra high molecular weight stuff.\nWhen selecting the range listed in the Nextera Kit manual, the average fragment size is ~530bp - the expected size should be ~600bp.\n\nSpoke with Steven about Library Geoduck MG #04 and we’ve opted to just leave it out.\nAll other samples were pooled into a single samples according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nThis pooled sample was stored in the same -20C box as above, in position I4.\n\nUPDATE 20180808\nAfter some confusion with the sequencing facility, I contacted Illumina regarding adapter sequences. I used the sequences provided for the Nextera DNA 24 CD Indexes (which was the index kit we used) on p.18 of the Illumina Index Adapter Pooling Guide.\nAs it turns out, these sequences are incorrect. The correct sequences are on p.12 of that document (the Nextera DNA 96 CD Indexes).\nI’ve updated the Google Sheet (linked above) to reflect the correct index sequences.\nEmail from Illumina is below. Even though he specifically references the H705 adapter, the correct sequence information for all i7 index adapters is found on p.12.\n\nHi Sam,\nThanks for the clarification! For the index sequence H705, this sequence is incorrect in the Index Adapters Pooling Guide. The correct information is found on page 12 of the same document and should be:\nH705 “AGGAGTCC” (Bases in Adapter) and “GGACTCCT” (bases for sample sheet.\nThis is also consistent with the Illumina Adapters letter.\nWe have provided this feed back to our colleagues to update the document so that all the information is consistent.\nThanks for your patience and understanding while we evaluated this issue. If we do have any other questions or concerns, please let us know and we would be happy to discuss this further.\nBest,\nRussell\nRussell Chan, Ph.D.\nTechnical Applications Scientist\nIllumina Technical Support\nTelephone available 24 hours\nMonday through Friday\nTechnical Bulletins: https://support.illumina.com/bulletins.html\nTrainings: https://support.illumina.com/traidexes"

    "text": "Yesterday, I annotated our Olympia oyster genome using WQ-MAKER in just 7hrs!.\nSee that link for run setup and configuration. They are essentially the same, except for the change I’ll discuss below.\nThe results from that run can be seen here:\n\nGenome Annotation – Olympia oyster genome annotation results #01\n\nIn that previous run, I neglected to provide a transposable elements FastA file for use with RepeatMasker.\nI remedied that and re-ran it. I modified maker_opts.ctl to include the following:\n<code>repeat_protein=../../opt/maker/data/te_proteins.fasta #provide a fasta file of transposable element proteins for RepeatRunner</code>\nThis TEs file is part of RepeatMasker.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOutput folder:\n\n20180807_wqmaker_run_oly_02\n\nAnnotated genome file (GFF):\n\n[20180807_wqmaker_run_oly_02/Olurida_v081.all.gff (1GB)(https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180807_wqmaker_run_oly_02/Olurida_v081.all.gff)\n\n\n\n\nThis run took about an hour longer than the previous run, but for some reason it ran with only 21 workers, instead of 22. This is probably the reason for the increased run time.\nI’d like to post a snippet of the GFF file here, but the line lengths are WAY too long and will be virtually impossible to read in this notebook. The GFF consists of listing a “parent” contig and its corresponding info (start/stop/length). Then, there are “children” of this contig that show various regions that are matched within the various databases that were queried, i.e. repeatmasker annotations for identifying repeat regions, protein2genome for full/partial protein matches, etc. Thus, a single scaffold (contig) can have dozens or hundreds of corresponding annotations!\nProbably the easiest and most logical to start working with will be those scaffolds that are annotated with a “protein_match”, as these have a corresponding GenBank ID. Parsing these out and then doing a join with NCBI protein IDs will give us a basic annotaiton of “functional” portions of the genome.\nAdditionally, we should probably do some sort of comparison of this run with the previous run where I did not provide the transposable elements FastA file."

However, it cannot detect the HDDs due to the Apple hardware RAID controller! Searching the internet has revealed that this is a commonly encountered issue with RAID’d Apple Xserves and Linux installs.\nI haven’t come across a means by which to remedy this. Will likely have to install an OS X version in order to make this computer usable. Although, that won’t limit us too terribly in regards to program usage. Most programs will run fine on OSX."

    "text": "Yesterday, our Xsede Startup Application (Google Doc) got approval for 100,000 Service Units (SUs) and 1TB of disk space on Xsede/Atmosphere/Jetstream (or, whatever it’s actually called!). The approval happened within an hour of submitting the application!\nHere’s a copy of the approval notice:\n\nDear Dr. Roberts:\nYour recently submitted an XSEDE Startup request has been reviewed and approved.\nPI: Steven Roberts, University of Washington\nRequest: Annotation of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) and Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) genomes using WQ_MAKER on Jetstream cloud.\nRequest Number: MCB180124 (New)\nStart Date: N/A\nEnd Date: 2019-08-05\nAwarded Resources: IU/TACC (Jetstream): 100,000.0 SUs\nIU/TACC Storage (Jetstream Storage): 1,000.0 GB\nAllocations Admin Comments:\nThe estimated value of these awarded resources is $14,890.00. The allocation of these resources represents a considerable investment by the NSF in advanced computing infrastructure for U.S. The dollar value of your allocation is estimated from the NSF awards supporting the allocated resources.\nIf XSEDE Extended Collaborative Support (ECSS) assistance was recommended by the review panel, you will be contacted by the ECSS team within the next two weeks to begin discussing this collaboration.\nBy default the PI and all co-PIs will be added to the resources awarded. If this is an award on a renewal request, current users will have their account end dates modified to reflect the new end date of this award. PIs, co-PIs, or Allocation Managers can add users to or remove users from resources on this project by logging into the portal (https://portal.xsede.org) and using the ‘Add/Remove User’ form.\nShare the impact of XSEDE! In exchange for access to the XSEDE ecosystem, we ask that all users let us know what XSEDE has helped you achieve:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all publications, please acknowledge use of XSEDE and allocated resources by citing the XSEDE paper (https://www.xsede.org/how-to-acknowledge-xsede) and also add your publications to your user profile.\n\n\n\n\nTell us about your achievements (https://www.xsede.org/group/xup/science-achievements).\n\n\n\n\nHelp us improve our reporting by keeping your XSEDE user profile up to date and completing the demographic fields (https://portal.xsede.org/group/xup/profile).\n\n\nFor question regarding this decision, please contact help@xsede.org.\nBest regards, XSEDE Resource Allocations Service\n===========================\nREVIEWER COMMENTS\n===========================\nReview #0 - Excellent\nAssessment and Summary: Maker is a well-known and fitting workflow for Jetstream. This should be a good use of resources.\nAppropriateness of Methodology:\nAfter each user on the allocation has logged in, the PI will need to open a ticket via help@xsede.org and request the quota be set per the allocation to 1TB. Please provide the XSEDE portal ID of each user.\nAppropriateness of Computational Research Plan:\nWe request that any publications stemming from work done using Jetstream cite us - https://jetstream-cloud.org/research/citing-jetstream.php\nEfficient Use of Resources:\n\n\nWe had a tremendous amount of help from Upendra Devisetty at CyVerse in getting the Xsede Startup Application written, as well as running WQ-MAKER on Xsede/Atmosphere/Jetstream (or, whatever it’s called!).\n\nNow, on to how I got the run going…\nI initiated the Olympia oyster genome annotation using a WQ-MAKER instance (MAKER 2.31.9 with CCTools v3.1) on Jetstream:\n\n\nI followed the excellent step-by-step directions here:\n\nMAKER 2.31.9 Jetstream Tutorial\n\nThe “MASTER” machine was a “m1.xlarge” machine (i.e. CPU: 24, Mem: 60 GB, Disk: 60 GB).\nI attached a 1TB volume to the MASTER machine.\nI set up the run using 21 “WORKER” machines. Twenty WORKERS were “m1.large” machines (i.e. CPU: 10, Mem: 30 GB, Disk: 60 GB). The remaining WORKER was set at “m1.xlarge” (i.e. CPU: 24, Mem: 60 GB, Disk: 60 GB) to use up the rest of our allocated memory.\n\n\nMASTER machine was initialized with the following command:\n<code>nohup wq_maker -contigs-per-split 1 -cores 1 -memory 2048 -disk 4096 -N wq_maker_oly${USER} -d all -o master.dbg -debug_size_limit=0 -stats test_out_stats.txt > log_file.txt 2>&1 &</code>\nEach WORKER was started with the following command:\n<code>nohup work_queue_worker -N wq_maker_oly${USER} --cores all --debug-rotate-max=0 -d all -o worker.dbg > log_file_2.txt 2>&1 &</code>\nWhen starting each WORKER, an error message was generated, but this doesn’t seem to have any impact on the ability of the program to run:\n\n\nI checked on the status of the run and you can see that there are 22 WORKERS and 15,568 files “WAITING”. BUT, there are 159,429 contigs in our genome FastA!\nWhy don’t these match??!!\nThis is because WQ-MAKER splits the genome FastA into smaller FastA files containg only 10 sequences each. This is why we see 10-fold fewer files being processed than sequences in our genome file.\n\n\nHere is the rest of the nitty gritty details:\n\nGenome file:\n\nOlurida_v081.fa\n\nSee our Genomic Resources GtiHub wiki for deets\n\n\n\n\nTranscriptome file:\n\nOlurida_transcriptome_v3.fasta\n\n\n\nProteome files (NCBI):\nThe two FastA files below were concatenated into a single FastA file (gigas_virginica_ncbi_proteomes.fasta) for use in WQ-MAKER.\n\nCrassostrea gigas\n\nGCA_000297895.1_oyster_v9_protein.faa.gz\n\nCrassostrea virginica\n\nGCF_002022765.2_C_virginica-3.0_protein.faa.gz\n\n\n\n\nMaker options control file (maker_opts.ctl):\nThis is a bit difficult to read in this notebook; copy and paste in text editor for easier viewing.\nNOTE: Paths to files (e.g. genome FastA) have to be relative paths; cannot be absolute paths!\n<code>\n#-----Genome (these are always required)\ngenome=../data/oly_genome/Olurida_v081.fa #genome sequence (fasta file or fasta embeded in GFF3 file)\norganism_type=eukaryotic #eukaryotic or prokaryotic.

This is unwieldly, so the GFFs will be merged using the following code:\n<code>$ gff3_merge -n -d Olurida_v081.maker.output/Olurida_v081_master_datastore_index.log</code>\nAll WORKERS were running as of 07:45 today. As of this posting (~3hrs later), WQ-MAKER had already processed ~45% of the files! Annotation will be finished by the end of today!!! Crazy!"

Used 5uL of sample for measurements.\nSamples were also assessed with the Roberts Lab NandoDrop1000.\nSamples were recovered from the pedestal after measurement.\nRNA was given to Grace for storage at -80C.\n\n\nRESULTS\nQubit measurements (Google Sheet): - 20180731_qubit_RNA_crab_cleanup\n\nNanoDrop Table:\n\n\nAll concentrations were too low for detection via NanoDrop.\nQubit quantification indicate yields ranging from ~25ng to ~192.5ng.\nWill share info with Grace and let her compare these numbers to her original concentrations to see if there’s any differences.\nRegardless, based on my earlier RNA isolation today, these samples should now be much cleaner and we should be able to trust the Qubit quantifications."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ll begin this entry with a TL;DR (becuase it’s definitely a very long read):\n\nSample weight (i.e. volume) appears to have an effect on total alkalinity (TA) determination, despite the fact that sample weight is taken into account when calculating TA.\nReplicates are relatively consistent.\nOur TA measurements of CO2 Reference Materials (CRMs) do not match TA info supplied with CRMs.\nConclusions?\n\nThe only thing that actually matters is consistent replicates.\nUse 50g (i.e. 50mL) sample weights - will greatly conserve reagents (CRMs, acid)\nCalculate offset from CRMs or just report our TA measurements and the corresponding CRM TA value(s)?\nAsk Hollie Putnam what she thinks.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, here’s a fairly lengthy overview of what has been done to date with the titrator. In essence, this is a cumulative notebook entry of all the entries I should have been doing on a daily/weekly basis (I actually feel much shame for neglecting this - it’s a terrible practice and an even worse example for other lab members).\n\nTeaser: there are graphs!\nAnyway, I’ve spent a lot of time getting our titrator, protocols, and scripts to a point where we can not only begin collecting real data, but also actually analyze the data in a semi-automated way.\nMore recently, I’ve finally started taking some measurements to assess the consistency of the actual titrator and stumbled across an interesting observation that may (may not) have an impact on how we proceed with sample/data handling.\n\n\n\nProtocols\nTitrator SOP is the primary protocol that encompasses setting up/shutting down the titrator, use of the LabX software needed for recording/exporting data from the titrator, and how to implement the necessary scripts to handle the exported data is still in early stages.\nIn theory, the SOP should be rather straightforward, but due to the sensitivity involved with these measurements, the SOP needs to carefully address how to set things up properly, provide a means for documenting startup/shutdown procedures, and provide troubleshooting assistance (e.g. how to empty/remove burette if/when air bubbles develop).\nOverall, it’s a bit of a beast, albeit and important one, but I’ve put it on the back burner in order to focus my efforts/time on getting to the point of being able to collect data from the titrator and feel confident that we’re getting good readings.\nOnce I get to that point and am able to begin running samples, I’ll be able to dedicate more time to fleshing out the SOP, including adding pictures of all the components.\n\n\n\nScripts\nparsing_TA_output.R is the script that has consumed the majority of my titrator-related time in the last couple of weeks. It is fully functional (it only requires manual entry of the exported LabX data file location). However, I’m hoping to eventually automate this as well - i.e. when new LabX export file appears, this script will execute. I won’t be spending much time on this aspect of the script until I\nThis has been my highest priority. Without having this script in a usable state, it has been a MAJOR slog to manually retrieve the appropriate data necessary to use in TA determination.\nThis also has been my biggest challenge with the titrator process. Here are just some of the hurdles I’ve had to deal with in putting this script together:\n\n“learning” R\nhandling “dynamic” titrator output data\n\nthis is not an easy task for a non-programmer!\nthe output data is of differing numbers of rows from sample to sample, so the script had to be able to handle this aspect automatically\nmaking the script “flexible” (i.e. no “magic numbers”) to handle any number of samples without the user having to manually modify the script\nmaking th script “flexible” by operating on column names instead of column numbers, since column numbers were/are not constant, depending on changes to the script\n\ncalculations resulting from two-part titration\n\nstill not sure if I ever would’ve figured this out if I hadn’t taken the intro computer science class at UW a couple of years ago!\n\n\nDespite all of this, I also feel like it’s one of my biggest accomplishments! It’s super satisfying to have this script functioning with virtually no user input required!\npH_calibration_check.R is still a work in progess, but is easily usable. Currently, it still has some hard-coded values (row numbers) in it for parsing data, but that should be easy to fix after what I went through with the TA parsing script!\nEventually, these two scripts will work in tandem, with the pH_calibration_check script exporting data to a daily “log” file, which the parsing_TA_output script will use to read-in the necessary pH data.\nTA_calculation.R will calculate the TA values, but currently requires fully manual data entry. It desperately needs attention and will likely be my primary focus in the immediate future, due to the need to have TA values for actual samples, as well as daily quality control checks (e.g. verify CRM measurements look OK before measuring actual samples).\n\n\n\nMeasurements\n\nConsistency checks with Instant Ocean\n\nInstant Ocean Tests\nI ran nine replicates of Instant Ocean (36g/L in deionized water) at two different samples weights/volume (50g, 75g) to make sure the titrator was producing consistent results.\nHere’s the R Studio Project folder with all the data/scripts used to gather the data and produce the plots:\n\n20180301_titrator_instant_ocean_tests\n\nTA values were determined using the seacarb R package. I used a salinity of 35 (seacarb default value?), but this has not been determined for this batch of Instant Ocean.\n\n\n\nSample Volume Mean TA Standard Deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n50mL\n\n\n669.4\n\n\n11.14\n\n\n\n\n75mL\n\n\n645.0\n\n\n11.96\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the low TA values when using Instant Ocean. I expected these to be more similar to sea water, but the Instant Ocean hasn’t been aerated, so maybe that could account for the low TA values. Regardless, this shouldn’t be too much of an issue, since I only wanted to use this to see if we were getting consistent measurements.\nThe second thing I noticed was the difference in TA values between the 50mL and 75mL samples. This is/was odd, as sample weight is taken into account with the seacarb package.\nSo, I decided to explore this a bit further, using the CRMs that we have. I felt that this would provide more informative data regarding measurement accuracy (i.e. do our measurements match a known value?), in addition to further evaluation of the effects of sample volume on TA determination.\n\n\n\nConsistency checks with CRMs\n\nCRM Tests\nI ran five replicates of [CRM Batch 168 (PDF)(https://github.com/RobertsLab/titrator/blob/master/data/crm_certifications/Batch168.pdf) at three different sample weights/volume (50g, 75g, 100g) to make sure the titrator was producing consistent results and evaulate how accurate our measurements are.\nHere’s the R Studio Project folder with all the data/scripts used to gather the data and produce the plots:\n\n20180305_titrator_crm_tests\n\nHere’s a bunch of graphs to consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Mean TA Standard Deviation\n\n\n\n\n\nCRM 168\n\n\n2071.47\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n50mL\n\n\n2259.66\n\n\n7.35\n\n\n\n\n75mL\n\n\n2236.22\n\n\n19.96\n\n\n\n\n100mL\n\n\n2226.73\n\n\n14.49\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst thing to notice is that all sample measurements, regardless of volume, produce a TA value that is ~10% higher than what the CRM is certified to be. I’ve previously discussed this with Hollie and she’s indicated that there are two options:\n\nCalculate an offset relative to what the CRM is supposed to be and apply this offset to any sample measurements.\nDo not determine offset and just report calculated values, while providing CRM info.\n\nThe next thing that I noticed is the 50mL (g) samples produced the most consistent measurements.\nThere also seems to be a pattern where fluctuations in TA values across replicates are mirrored by changes in weight for each corresponding replicate.\nFinally, although it isn’t explicitly addressed, there is a time element in play here. As sample number increases, the longer those samples sat in the sample changer before titration. Oddly, it appears that there could be an effect on samples as they sit (e.g. sample evaporation prior to titration) when one considers the 75mL and 100mL samples, but both of those result in opposing trends, while the 50mL samples do not seem to suffer from any sort of time-related changes…\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wrap Up\nWhew! We made it! I’ll wait to get some feedback from lab members and Hollie before cranking through all of Hollie’s samples, but I feel pretty good about proceeding with a 50mL sample volume. If we decide to calculate an offset later on, it should only be a relatively minor tweak to our script.\nNext up, figure out a way to pull out all of Hollie’s salinity data for the samples I’m going to measure and incorporate that into the TA_calculation.R script."

    "text": "Steven wanted transposable elements (TEs) in the Olympia oyster genome identified.\nAfter some minor struggles, I was able to get RepeatMasker installed on on both of our Apple Xserves (emu & roadrunner; running Ubuntu 16.04LTS).\nGenome used: pbjelly_sjw_01\nI ran RepeatMasker (v4.07) with RepBase-20170127 and RMBlast 2.6.0 four times:\n\nDefault settings (i.e. no species select - will use human genome).\nSpecies = Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster)\nSpecies = Crassostrea virginica (Eastern oyster)\nSpecies = Ostrea lurida (Olympia oyster)\n\nThe idea was to get a sense of how the analyses would differ with species specifications. However, it’s likely that the only species setting that will make any difference will be Run #2 (Crassostrea gigas).\nThe reason I say this is that RepeatMasker has a built in tool to query which species are available in the RepBase database (e.g.):\n<code>RepeatMasker-4.0.7/util/queryRepeatDatabase.pl -species \"crassostrea virginica\" -stat</code>\nHere’s a very brief overview of what that yields:\n\nCrassotrea gigas: 792 specific repeats\nCrassostrea virginica: 4 Crassostrea virginica specific repeats\nOstrea lurida: 0 Ostrea lurida specific repeats\n\nAll runs were performed on roadrunner.\nAll commands were documented in a Jupyter Notebook (GitHub):\n\n20180523_roadrunner_oly_TEs_repeatmasker.ipynb\n\n_NOTE: RepeatMasker writes the desired output files (.out, .cat.gz, and *.gff) to the same directory that the genome is located in!

    "text": "Yesterday, I annotated our Olympia oyster genome using WQ-MAKER in just 7hrs!.\nSee that link for run setup and configuration.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBefore proceeding further, it should be noted that I neglected to provide Maker with a transposable elements FastA file for RepeatMasker to use.\nThe following line in the maker_opts.ctl file was originally populated with an absolute path to data I didn’t recognize, so I removed it:\n<code>repeat_protein= #provide a fasta file of transposable element proteins for RepeatRunner</code>\nI’m not entirely sure what the impacts will be on annotation, so I’ve re-run Maker with that line restored (using a relative path). You can find the results of that run here:\n\nGenome Annotation – Olympia oyster genome annotation results #02\n\nOutput folder:\n\n20180807_wqmaker_run_oly_01\n\nAnnotated genome file (GFF):\n\n[20180807_wqmaker_run_oly_01/Olurida_v081.all.gff (1GB)(https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180807_wqmaker_run_oly_01/Olurida_v081.all.gff)\n\nI’d like to post a snippet of the GFF file here, but the line lengths are WAY too long and will be virtually impossible to read in this notebook. The GFF consists of listing a “parent” contig and its corresponding info (start/stop/length). Then, there are “children” of this contig that show various regions that are matched within the various databases that were queried, i.e. repeatmasker annotations for identifying repeat regions, protein2genome for full/partial protein matches, etc. Thus, a single scaffold (contig) can have dozens or hundreds of corresponding annotations!\nProbably the easiest and most logical approach from here is to start working with scaffolds that are annotated with a “protein_match”, as these have a corresponding GenBank ID. Parsing these out and then doing a join with a database of NCBI protein IDs will give us a basic annotation of “functional” portions of the genome.\nAdditionally, we should probably do some sort of comparison of this run with the follow up run where I provided the transposable elements FastA file to see what impacts the exclusion/inclusion of that info had on annotation."

However, I’m not terribly surprised, as this happened previously (only using NovaSeq data) with a kmer setting of 117.\nI’ve posted an issue on the kmergenie GitHub page; we’ll see what happens."

    "text": "NOTE: IMPORTANT CAVEATS - READ POST BEFORE USING DATA.\n\n\nI’m posting this for posterity and to provide an overview of what (and whatnot) to do. Plus, this has a good R script for using MethylKit that can be used for subsequent analyses.\nThe goal of this analysis was to compare the methylation profiles of Olympia oysters originating from a common population (Fidalgo Bay) that were raised in two different locations (Fidalgo Bay & Oyster Bay).\nAn overview of the experiment can be viewed here:\n\nGitHub Wiki: Whole-genome-BSseq-December-2015\n\nI previously ran all of Olympia oyster DNA methylation sequencing data through the Bismark pipeline, and then processed them using the MethylKit R library.\nFirst mistake (Bismark):\n\nTrimmed FastQ files “incorrectly”.\n\nBismark provides an excellent user guide and provides a handy table on how to decide on trimming parameters, but I mistakenly trimmed these according to the recommendations for a different library preparation technique. I trimmed based on the Zymo Pico-Methyl Kit (which was used for the other group of data that I processed simultaneously), instead of the TruSeq library prep.\nSo, “incorrectly” isn’t necessarily the proper term here. The analysis can still be used, however, it’s likely that the excessive trimming results in reducing sequencing coverage, and, in turn, making the downstream analysis result in a highly conservative output. Thus, the data isn’t wrong or bad, it is just very limited.\nAnd, this leads to the second mistake (Bismark):\n\nBowtie alignment score too strict\n\nThere’s a bit of a weird “battle” between Bismark and bowtie2. Bismark uses bowtie2 for generating alignments, but bowtie2’s default cutoff score overrides Bismark’s. So, to adjust the score value, you have to explicitly add the scoring parameters to your Bismark parameters during the alignment step. I did not do this.\nAgain, it’s not wrong, per se, but leads to a significantly limited set of data in the final analysis.\nThe data were analyzed based on a minimum of:\n\n3x coverage\n25% difference in methylation\n\n\n\n\nRESULTS:\nMethylkit analysis (R project; GitHub):\n\n20180827_oly_methylkit\n\nBedGraph file (BED):\n\nOlyFbOb_3xCov_25percentDiff.bed\n\nThe analysis resulted in a total of seven (yes, 7) differentially methylated loci (DML) between the two groups. It was this result that made Steven and me revisit the initial Bismark analysis. He has done this previously (but differently) and gotten significantly greater numbers of DML.\nKnowing all of this, I will re-trim the data and adjust Bismark alignment score thresholds and then re-analyze with MethylKit.\nRegardless here’re some plots to add some visual flair to this notebook entry (these, and more, are available in the GitHub repo):\n\nCLUSTERING DENDROGRAM\n\n\n\n\nPCA PLOT"

    "text": "Received geoduck hatchery metagenome samples from Emma. These samples are intended for DNA isolation.\nAdmittedly, I’m a bit skeptical that we’ll be able to recover any DNA from these samples, as they had been initially stored as frozen liquid, then thawed, and “supernatant” removed. I’m concerned that the freezing step would result in cell lysis; thus the subsequent removal of “supernatant” would actually be removing the majority of cellular contents that would be released during freezing/lysis.\nHere’s the sample prep history, per Emma’s email:\n\nHi! Here are the relevant details from my lab notebook:\nFilters with bacteria to be extracted for proteomics: https://sr320.github.io/Geoduck-larvae-filters/\nEach filter was rinsed and cells sonicated:\n\n\n\n\n\nPut filter on petri dish on ice\n\n\n\n\nUse 1-4 mL total to wash front (and back if not obvious where biol material is) of filter while holding with forceps over dish - Use 2 pairs of forceps; I used 4 mL ice cold 50 mM NH4HCO3 to wash inside of filter (filters were folded in half). Washed filters returned to bags and stored at -80C.\n\n\n\n\nPut wash collected in dish in eppendorf tubes - at this point, remove the amount that will be used for metagenomics (~1/4 of wash) - put 1 mL in metagenome tube (mg) and the remaining was split between 2 tubes for metaproteomics (mp)\n\n\nThese are bacterial cells in ammonium bicarbonate. I spun them down and removed most of the supernatant from each tube.\nLet me know if you need any other info!\n\nBox of samples (containing ~38uL of liquid) were stored in FTR209 -20C (top shelf)."

More specifically, friggin’ Boost libraries! Trying to install these properly has been an issue in the past for non-Mox computers, too. I remember a few times discussing the pain of installing Boost with Sean Bennett.\n\n\nSOAPdenovo2\n\nOur Mox node can’t handle the memory requirements needed for assembly.\n\nJR-Assembler\n\nCan’t install one of the dependencies (SOAP error correction)\nActually, I need to try the binary version of this, instead of the source version (the source version fails at the make step)\n\nSo, next up will trying the following two assemblers:\n\nJR-Assembler: Will see if SOAPec binary will work, and then run an assembly.\nAllPaths-LG: I was able to install this successfully on Mox.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve ordered some additional hard drives and will be converting the old head/master node on the Apple Xserve cluster to Linux. The old master node is a little better equipped than the other Apple Xserve “birds”, so will try to re-run Meraculous on it once we get it converted."

Who knows what impact this will have on RNA, but it’s worth a shot!\nIsolated RNA from three crab hemolymph samples preserved in RNAlater (Test 1, Test 2, Test 3) that had been lyophilized overnight last week.\nSamples were provided by Grace.\nI believe the primary purpose for this particular test was to verify that the freeze dryer was a feasible tool, since Grace experienced a minor mishap when she attempted the lyohpilization initially.\nLyophilization was successful, without any mess.\n\nTEST 3 LYOPHILIZATION\n\n\nIsolated RNA using TriReagent, according to manufacturer’s protocol:\nAdded 1mL TriReagent to each tube, vortexed to mix/dissolve solute, incubated 5mins at RT, added 200uL of chloroform, vortexed 15s to mix, incubated at RT for 5mins, centrifuged 15mins, 12,000g, 4oC, transferred aqueous phase to new tube, added 500uL isopropanol to aqueous phase, mixed, incubated at RT for 10mins, centrifuged 8mins, 12,000g, at RT, discarded supernatant, added 1mL 75% ethanol, centrifuged 5mins, 12,000g at RT, discarded supernatant and resuspended in 10uL of 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O.\nQuantified RNA using Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 with the Qubit RNA high sensitivity kit.

However, I have not evaluated RNA integrity on the Bioanalyzer. I think Grace has some additional samples she wanted to test this method on, so I think we’ll wait until there are more samples before we use the Bioanalyzer.\nWill give sample to Grace for -80oC storage."
